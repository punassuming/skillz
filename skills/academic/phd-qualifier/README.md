Claude: I'll provide a comprehensive evaluation of your qualifier report using my phd-qualifier expertise...

[Provides detailed section-by-section feedback]

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overall Assessment: Pass with minor revisions

Key Strengths:
- Thorough literature review with 62 current references
- Well-designed experiments with appropriate controls
- Clear results presentation with professional figures
- Insightful discussion connecting results to theory

Critical Issues:
- Methods section needs more detail on uncertainty analysis (page 4)

OVERALL: Strong presentation with minor improvements needed

STORY & FLOW
Strengths:
- Clear motivation (slides 1-3)

- Font size on Figure 4 too small (suggest 18pt minimum)

TIME MANAGEMENT
- Current: 26 slides for 20 minutes
- Recommend: Reduce to 20-22 slides
- Suggested cuts: Combine slides 6-7, remove slide 14

[Continues with slide-by-slide feedback...]
```

### Example 3: Question Preparation
```
You: I need to prepare questions for a PhD qualifier on catalyst design using machine learning

Claude: I'll prepare a comprehensive question list for this qualifying exam. Let me first search for recent work in this area to ensure the questions are current and probe the right depth...

[Performs literature search]

I found recent relevant work including:
- Kumar et al. (2024) on ML-guided catalyst screening
- The OMol25 dataset release
- Recent debates about model interpretability

QUALIFYING EXAM QUESTIONS

=== WARM-UP (5 minutes) ===
1. Can you briefly explain your overall approach to using ML for catalyst design?
2. What motivated you to apply machine learning to this problem?
3. What was your personal contribution versus using existing tools?

=== GENERAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING (7 minutes) ===
4. How does your ML approach relate to traditional thermodynamic and kinetic principles in catalysis?
5. What are the potential industrial applications of ML-guided catalyst design?
6. How might this approach impact sustainable chemical processing?

=== TECHNICAL DEPTH (12 minutes) ===
7. Why did you choose [specific ML architecture] over alternatives like graph neural networks?
8. How did you validate your model predictions experimentally?
9. Walk me through your feature engineering process - why those particular descriptors?
10. What are the main sources of uncertainty in your predictions?
11. How did you handle the limited training data available for your system?

[Continues with more categories...]

AREAS TO PROBE:
- Recent work by Kumar et al. uses similar approach - ask for comparison
- Model interpretability seems like potential weakness
- Training data size may be concerning
