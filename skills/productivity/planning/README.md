# Planning & Project Breakdown Skill

Expert guidance for structured, realistic planning using proven project management frameworks and methodologies.

## Overview

This skill enables Claude to facilitate professional-grade project planning and breakdown using established planning methodologies. Whether you need to create project plans, estimate timelines, identify risks, allocate resources, or develop strategic roadmaps, this skill provides structured approaches and planning expertise.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need:
- Project or initiative planning
- Work breakdown and task decomposition
- Timeline estimation and scheduling
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Resource allocation planning
- Milestone and success criteria definition
- Strategic roadmap development
- Backward planning from deadlines
- Dependency identification
- Contingency planning

## Triggers

The skill activates for requests like:
- "Help me plan..."
- "Create a roadmap for..."
- "Break down this project..."
- "What are the steps to..."
- "How should I approach..."
- "Build a timeline for..."
- "Estimate how long..."
- "Identify risks for..."

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Hierarchical decomposition into manageable components:
- **Project → Phases → Deliverables → Tasks**
- 100% rule ensures completeness
- Progressive detail (stop at 1-3 day tasks)
- Clear accountability

**Best for**: Large complex projects, scope definition, comprehensive task inventory

### 2. Backward Planning
Start from deadline and work backwards:
- Define end state precisely
- Identify immediate prerequisites
- Work backwards to present
- Calculate buffer times
- Reverse to forward timeline

**Best for**: Fixed deadlines, events, product launches, deadline-driven work

### 3. Critical Path Method (CPM)
Identify longest sequence determining minimum duration:
- Forward pass (early start/finish)
- Backward pass (late start/finish)
- Calculate float/slack
- Focus on critical tasks

**Best for**: Complex dependencies, schedule optimization, resource prioritization

**Tool**: Use `scripts/critical_path.py` for automated calculation

### 4. Timeline Estimation
Realistic duration forecasting:
- **Bottom-up**: Estimate each task, sum up
- **Top-down**: Estimate overall, allocate
- **Three-point**: (Optimistic + 4×Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
- **Analogous**: Compare to past projects
- **Parametric**: Use historical data rates

**Includes**: 20-30% buffers, effort vs duration, capacity planning

### 5. Agile/Iterative Planning
Short cycles with adaptation:
- Sprint planning (2-week iterations)
- Velocity tracking
- Backlog grooming
- Daily standups
- Retrospectives

**Best for**: Uncertain requirements, software development, need for flexibility

### 6. Phased/Milestone Planning
Staged approach with checkpoints:
- Phase gates and reviews
- Stage-by-stage approval
- Risk reviews at transitions
- Progress milestones

**Best for**: Long projects (3+ months), regulatory requirements, staged delivery

### 7. Risk Management
Proactive risk identification and mitigation:
- Risk identification (categories, pre-mortems)
- Assessment (probability × impact)
- Response strategies (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept)
- Trigger indicators and contingency plans

**Template**: Use `assets/templates/risk_register_template.csv`

### 8. Resource Planning
People, tools, budget allocation:
- RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
- Capacity planning
- Budget estimation with contingency
- External dependencies

### 9. OKRs & SMART Goals
Strategic objective setting:
- **OKRs**: Objectives + Key Results (3-5 measurable outcomes)
- **SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- Quarterly/annual goal frameworks

**Best for**: Strategic planning, team goals, outcome focus

### 10. Contingency Planning
Prepare for uncertainty:
- Schedule buffers (20-30% for novel work)
- Budget contingency (10-20%)
- Scope priorities (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Plan B for critical paths
- Re-planning triggers

   - Dependencies and assumptions
   - Stakeholders

2. **Choose Approach** (2 min)

3. **Decompose** (15-30 min)
   - Break into phases/deliverables/tasks
   - Identify dependencies
   - Assign owners

4. **Sequence** (10-20 min)
   - Order by dependencies
   - Identify parallel work
   - Calculate critical path

5. **Estimate** (15-30 min)
   - Duration estimates
   - Add buffers (20-30%)
   - Account for capacity

6. **Define Success** (10 min)
   - Milestones
   - Success metrics
   - Acceptance criteria

7. **Identify Risks** (15 min)
   - What could go wrong
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Contingency plans

8. **Document** (10 min)
   - Clear, actionable plan
   - Owners and deadlines
   - Next steps

## Planning Principles

**Right-Size the Approach**
- Simple projects need simple plans
- Complex projects warrant comprehensive planning
- Don't over-plan

**Involve the Team**
- People doing work should help plan
- Multiple perspectives improve estimates
- Creates buy-in and commitment

**Plan Iteratively**
- Start high-level
- Add detail progressively
- Don't plan too far ahead in detail

**Include Buffers**
- 20-30% for uncertain work
- More for novel/complex tasks
- Account for unknowns

**Stay Flexible**
- Plans are tools, not contracts
- Adapt when reality differs
- Re-plan when assumptions change

## Usage Examples

### Project Planning
```
"Help me plan a website redesign project with a 3-month timeline"
→ Clarify scope → Choose WBS + Phased approach → Create detailed plan
```

### Timeline Estimation
```
"How long will it take to migrate our database to the cloud?"
→ Break down tasks → Apply estimation techniques → Add buffers → Create timeline
```

### Risk Assessment
```
"What risks should I consider for launching this new product?"
→ Risk identification → Assessment → Mitigation strategies → Contingency plans
```

### Agile Sprint Planning
```
"Help me plan our next 2-week sprint with these user stories"
→ Capacity calculation → Story breakdown → Commitment → Sprint goal
```

### Backward Planning
```
"We're launching December 1st - help me work backwards to create a plan"
→ Define end state → Identify prerequisites → Work backwards → Create timeline
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Clarify before planning**: 5 minutes of clarification saves hours later
2. **Use appropriate detail**: Match planning depth to certainty and timeline
3. **Include buffers**: Under-promising and over-delivering builds trust
4. **Identify dependencies early**: They're often the critical path
5. **Plan for risks**: Hope for the best, plan for the realistic
6. **Document clearly**: Plans are communication tools
7. **Review regularly**: Compare actual to plan, learn and adapt
8. **Make plans actionable**: Every task needs an owner and deadline
