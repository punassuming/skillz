# FAIRChem Skill

Expert assistance for using Meta's [FAIRChem](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem) (formerly Open Catalyst Project) - a machine learning library for ultra-fast materials science and quantum chemistry calculations.

## What This Skill Does

This skill enhances Claude Code with deep knowledge of FAIRChem, enabling it to help you:

- **Use ML potentials** - Replace slow DFT with 100-1000× faster ML predictions
- **Run multi-domain calculations** - Same model for catalysis, materials, molecules, MOFs
- **Scale to large systems** - Handle 1000s of atoms with multi-GPU support
- **Integrate with ASE** - Drop-in replacement for traditional calculators
- **Optimize structures** - Fast geometry optimization and MD simulations
- **Screen candidates** - High-throughput workflows for materials discovery

## When to Use This Skill

Claude will automatically use this skill when you're working with FAIRChem. You can also explicitly request it:

- "Using the fairchem skill, help me set up a catalyst screening workflow"
- "How do I use UMA models for molecular dynamics?"
- "Show me how to optimize a bulk crystal with FAIRChem"

## What You Get

### 1. Complete Working Examples

Get production-ready code for all FAIRChem use cases:

```python
# Example: "Help me optimize a Cu slab with CO adsorbate"
from fairchem.data.ase import FAIRChemCalculator
from fairchem.predict import load_predict_unit
from ase.build import fcc111, add_adsorbate
from ase.optimize import LBFGS

# Load UMA model
predict_unit = load_predict_unit("uma-m-1p1")

# Create calculator for catalysis
calc = FAIRChemCalculator(
    predict_unit=predict_unit,
    task_name="oc20"  # Catalysis domain
)

# Build and optimize
slab = fcc111("Cu", size=(4, 4, 4), vacuum=10.0)
add_adsorbate(slab, "CO", height=2.0)
slab.calc = calc

opt = LBFGS(slab)
opt.run(fmax=0.05)
```

### 2. Domain-Specific Guidance

FAIRChem uses task names for different chemistry domains:

| Task | Domain | Use For |
|------|--------|---------|
| `oc20` | Catalysis | Surfaces + adsorbates |
| `omat` | Materials | Bulk crystals, defects |
| `omol` | Molecules | Organic chemistry |
| `odac` | MOFs | Metal-organic frameworks |
| `omc` | Crystals | Molecular crystals |

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Multi-GPU scaling with `workers=N`
- Turbo mode for maximum speed
- Model selection guidance (small vs medium)
- Memory optimization tips

### 4. Complete Workflows

- Surface adsorption energy calculations
- Bulk lattice optimization
- Molecular dynamics simulations
- NEB reaction barriers
- High-throughput screening

## Key Features

### Universal Models (UMA)
- **One model, many domains** - Switch domains with `task_name`
- **`uma-s-1p1`** - Small, fast (~50M params)
- **`uma-m-1p1`** - Medium, accurate (~300M params)

### ASE Integration
- Drop-in replacement for DFT calculators
- Works with all ASE tools (optimization, MD, NEB, etc.)
- Familiar interface for ASE users

### Speed
- **100-1000× faster than DFT**
- Multi-GPU support for large systems
- Turbo mode for maximum performance

### Scale
- Handle 1000s of atoms
- Distributed inference across GPUs
- Efficient for high-throughput screening

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Choose the right task** - Match `task_name` to your chemistry domain
2. **Start with turbo** - Use turbo mode for initial screening
3. **Validate critical results** - Compare ML predictions with DFT for important cases
4. **Use appropriate model** - Small for speed, medium for accuracy
5. **Leverage GPUs** - Use `workers=N` for large batches

## Common Questions

**Q: Which model should I use?**
- Screening/MD: `uma-s-1p1` + turbo
- Production: `uma-m-1p1`
- Very large systems: `uma-s-1p1` + workers

**Q: How accurate is FAIRChem?**
- Typical error: ~0.1 eV (0.05-0.2 eV range)
- Good for screening and ranking
- Validate critical results with DFT

**Q: Can I use my own trained model?**
- Yes, use `load_predict_unit("/path/to/checkpoint.pt")`

**Q: What about uncertainty?**
- UMA models don't provide uncertainty estimates
- Test on similar known systems first
- Validate against DFT for critical results
