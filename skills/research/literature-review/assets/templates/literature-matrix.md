## Creating Your Literature Matrix

### Step 1: Set Up Spreadsheet
- Use Excel, Google Sheets, or Airtable
- Start with basic template (7-10 columns)
- Expand as needed for your review

### Step 2: Populate from Reading
- Read each paper's abstract and introduction
- Extract key information into matrix
- Continue updating as you read full paper

### Step 3: Sort and Filter
- Sort by quality to identify best evidence
- Filter by outcome to compare results
- Group by theme for synthesis

### Step 4: Analyze Patterns
- Look for effect size patterns
- Identify methodological variations
- Note populations underrepresented
- Spot conflicting findings

### Step 5: Use for Writing
- Reference matrix while writing synthesis
- Matrix serves as fact-check for statements
- Use for creating summary tables in report

## Tips for Effective Matrix

1. **Keep it organized**: Consistent formatting, complete entries
2. **Use consistent terminology**: Same labels across rows
3. **Include quality assessment**: Weight evidence by quality
4. **Add hyperlinks**: Link to DOI or PDF for easy reference
5. **Use conditional formatting**: Color-code by quality, effect size, theme
6. **Update regularly**: Maintain as you add/remove papers
7. **Create submatrices**: Separate matrices for different themes/outcomes
8. **Document decisions**: Notes section for inclusion/exclusion rationale

## Example: Using Matrix for Synthesis

### Identifying Consensus

```
Matrix review shows:
- 35/40 studies (87%) report positive effect
- Effect size range: d = 0.3-1.2
- Quality doesn't predict effect size (Grade A and D show similar effects)
- Trend over time: increasing effect sizes in recent studies

Interpretation:
- Strong consensus for effectiveness
- Consistent across methodologies
- Improving methodology over time suggests real effect
```

### Identifying Gaps

```
Matrix review shows:
- Geographic: 80% of studies from USA/Europe
- Population: Only 3 studies in [specific population]
- Outcome: Primary outcome well-covered (38/40)
           but safety outcomes limited (12/40)
- Timeline: Follow-up mostly <6 months (28/40)

Identified gaps:
- Need research in underrepresented regions/populations
- Need longer-term follow-up studies
- Need comprehensive safety assessment
```

### Identifying Heterogeneity

```
Matrix analysis reveals:
- By methodology: Traditional ML (d=0.4) vs. DL (d=0.8)
  → Different methods produce different results
- By population: Mild cases (d=0.3) vs. Severe cases (d=0.9)
  → Effect size depends on baseline severity
- By outcome: Objective measures (d=0.7) vs. Self-report (d=0.5)
  → Measurement type affects effect size

Explanation for heterogeneity:
- Methodological differences are substantial
- Study populations not comparable
- Different outcome measures capture different constructs
