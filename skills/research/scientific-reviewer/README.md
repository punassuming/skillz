# Scientific Reviewer Skill

A comprehensive skill for conducting rigorous peer review of scientific documents including research articles, review papers, methods papers, technical reports, and preprints.

## Quick Start

Activate this skill when you need to:
- Review scientific manuscripts for publication
- Evaluate research claims and supporting evidence
- Assess experimental design and methodology
- Check citation adequacy and suggest references
- Provide constructive feedback on scientific writing
- Evaluate technical accuracy and reproducibility

## Key Features

- **Document Classification**: Identifies research document type and scope
- **Claims Analysis**: Maps claims to evidence and assesses support quality
- **Methodological Review**: Evaluates experimental design, controls, and statistical analysis
- **Citation Analysis**: Checks literature coverage and suggests missing references
- **Technical Accuracy**: Verifies calculations, figures, and methodological details
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provides balanced, actionable suggestions for improvement

## Review Dimensions

1. **Claims and Evidence**: Systematic evaluation of assertions and supporting data
2. **Logic and Argumentation**: Assessment of reasoning structure and internal consistency
3. **Citation Adequacy**: Review of literature coverage and reference quality
4. **Methodological Soundness**: Evaluation of experimental design and execution
5. **Technical Accuracy**: Verification of calculations, figures, and terminology
6. **Presentation Quality**: Assessment of writing clarity and organization

## Output Format

Reviews are organized into:
- **Executive Summary**: Overall assessment and recommendation
- **Detailed Review**: Section-by-section analysis with specific feedback
- **Claims Assessment**: Evidence evaluation for major assertions
- **Citation Review**: Literature gaps and suggested references
- **Minor Issues**: Grammar, formatting, and presentation improvements

## Best Used For

- Peer review of journal submissions
- Internal review of draft manuscripts
- Evaluation of preprints or technical reports
- Assessment of student research papers
- Quality control for research documentation

## Integration

Works well with:
- **literature-review**: For comprehensive literature searches
- **scientific-writing**: For addressing writing and clarity issues
- **eln**: For documenting review process and decisions

## Usage Example

```
Please review this manuscript on [topic]. I need a comprehensive peer review
addressing claims, methodology, citation adequacy, and technical accuracy.
```

The skill will provide structured, constructive feedback following professional peer review standards.
