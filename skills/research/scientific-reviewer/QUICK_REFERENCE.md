## Recommendation Categories

| Recommendation | Criteria | Typical Issues |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **Accept** | Minor revisions only | Typos, minor clarifications |
| **Minor Revisions** | Fixable issues, no new data | Citation gaps, analysis clarification, presentation |
| **Major Revisions** | Significant issues, possible new data | Methodological concerns, missing controls, weak analysis |
| **Reject** | Fundamental flaws | Fatal design flaws, unsupported claims, irreproducible |

## Common Issues to Check

### Methodological Red Flags
- No controls or inappropriate controls
- Insufficient sample size without justification
- Cherry-picking data or selective reporting
- Statistical fishing (p-hacking)
- Confounding variables not addressed
- Circular reasoning

### Citation Problems
- Key foundational work not cited
- Over-reliance on self-citations
- Misrepresentation of cited work
- Missing recent relevant publications
- Ignoring contradictory findings

### Presentation Issues
- Figures illegible or poorly labeled
- Tables missing error bars or statistics
- Inconsistent terminology
- Methods lack reproducibility detail
- Results and discussion conflated
- Overstated conclusions
