Professional scientific documentation using org-mode for reproducible research and comprehensive record-keeping.

## What This Skill Does

This skill enhances Claude Code with expertise in maintaining professional electronic lab notebooks, enabling it to help you:

- **Structure notebook entries** - Create well-organized, date-based research documentation
- **Document experiments** - Record hypotheses, methods, results, and conclusions
- **Ensure reproducibility** - Include all details needed to reproduce your work
- **Use org-mode effectively** - Leverage properties, tags, links, and code blocks
- **Maintain research integrity** - Follow best practices for scientific documentation
- **Cross-reference work** - Link related entries and build knowledge networks
- **Archive data** - Organize data files and computational outputs
- **Generate summaries** - Create project overviews and progress reports

## When to Use This Skill

Claude will automatically use this skill when you're working on lab notebook documentation. You can also explicitly request it:

- "Using the eln skill, help me document this experiment"
- "Create a lab notebook entry for today's calculations"
- "How should I document this failed attempt?"
- "Help me write a monthly summary of my research"

## Core Principles

### 1. Chronological Organization
Files organized by date for easy navigation:
```
notebook/
├── 2025/
│   ├── 01-January/
│   │   ├── 2025-01-15.org
│   │   └── 2025-01-20.org
│   └── 02-February/
```

### 2. Complete Documentation
Every entry includes:
- **What** - Detailed description of work performed
- **Why** - Hypothesis, motivation, reasoning
- **How** - Methods, procedures, parameters
- **Results** - Observations, data, outputs
- **Analysis** - Interpretation and meaning
- **Next** - Follow-up work and questions

### 3. Reproducibility
Documentation enables anyone to:
- Understand your reasoning
- Reproduce your work exactly
- Access all data and code
- Follow your logic chain

### 4. Professional Standards
- Clear, professional writing
- Honest reporting (including failures)
- Dated and timestamped entries
- Never delete past entries (make corrections forward)
- Sufficient detail for independent reproduction

## Example Entry Structure

#+TITLE: Lab Notebook - 2025-01-15
#+AUTHOR: Your Name
#+DATE: [2025-01-15 Wed]
#+FILETAGS: :experiment:catalyst:

* Daily Summary
Validated DFT methodology for catalyst screening project.
Compared three functionals against experimental data.
Selected PBE for production runs.

* [09:30] DFT Functional Validation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 2025-01-15-001
:PROJECT: Catalyst_Screening
:STATUS: Complete
:END:

** Objective
Determine which DFT functional best reproduces experimental
CO adsorption energies on Pt(111).

** Hypothesis
PBE will provide reasonable agreement (within 0.3 eV) based
on literature precedent.

** Methods
Calculated CO adsorption using three functionals:
- PBE (standard GGA)
- PBE+D3 (with dispersion)
- RPBE (revised PBE)

Parameters: 400 eV cutoff, 6×6×1 k-points, 0.05 eV/Å forces

** Results
| Functional | E_ads (eV) | Experiment | Error |
|------------+------------+------------+-------|
| PBE        |     -1.82  |      -1.60 | -0.22 |
| PBE+D3     |     -2.15  |      -1.60 | -0.55 |
| RPBE       |     -1.45  |      -1.60 |  0.15 |

** Analysis
- PBE shows best agreement (error 0.22 eV)
- PBE+D3 significantly overbinds (0.55 eV error)
- RPBE underestimates binding

** Conclusions
**Decision: Use PBE for production calculations.**
Expected error ~0.2 eV, acceptable for screening purposes.

** Next Steps
- [ ] Begin screening of FCC metals
- [ ] Document PBE choice in methods section
