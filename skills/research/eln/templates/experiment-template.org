** Objective
Clear statement of what you're trying to accomplish.

** Hypothesis
What you expect to happen and why.

Example: Based on literature precedent (Smith 2024), we expect
the adsorption energy to be approximately -1.5 eV for FCC binding.

** Background/Context
- Why is this work important?
- What previous work led to this experiment?
- What are the key questions being addressed?
