# Video Storytelling Skill

AI-powered video storytelling that creates coherent multi-scene narratives with consistent visuals and narrated audio, assembled into professional MP4 videos.

## Overview

This skill combines image generation and audio synthesis to create complete video stories with:

- **Visual Consistency** - Characters and style remain coherent across all scenes
- **Narrative Audio** - Professional voice narration with emotional expression
- **Automated Assembly** - Images and audio merged into final MP4 video
- **Multi-Scene Stories** - Default 6 scenes (1 title + 5 story scenes)
- **Customizable** - Flexible story structure, characters, and visual styles

Perfect for creating educational content, children's stories, social media videos, presentations, and creative projects.

3. Create narrated audio with emotion
4. Assemble everything into final MP4 video

## Features

### Visual Consistency

**STYLE_LOCK** - Global visual rules:
- Aspect ratio: 1080×1080 (square, Instagram-ready)
- Lighting: Soft three-point lighting, warm 4500K
- Colors: Consistent palette with hex codes
- Style: Semi-realistic cartoon (customizable)
- Camera: 50mm lens, eye-level perspective

**CHARACTER_LOCK** - Maintain character appearance:
- Exact colors and features
- Consistent clothing and accessories
- Same art style across scenes
- Scale and proportions maintained

**Multi-Turn Generation** - Each scene references previous:
- Scene 0 establishes visual foundation
- Scenes 1-5 reference Scene 0 for consistency
- Prevents style drift and character changes

### Narrative Audio

**Text-to-Speech with ElevenLabs:**

**Emotion Tags:**
- neutral, happy, sad, surprised
- excited, focused, curious, triumphant
- And many more for nuanced delivery

### Video Assembly

**Automated Pipeline:**
- Concatenate all scene audio → merged_audio.mp3
- Calculate timing: total_duration / num_scenes
- Create video from images with equal timing
- Merge video and audio → final_video.mp4

**Output Specifications:**
- Resolution: 1080x1080 (square)
- Frame rate: 30 fps
- Video codec: H.264
- Audio codec: AAC (192 kbps)
- Duration: ~90-120 seconds typical

## Default Story Structure

### 6 Scenes (Recommended)

**Scene 0: Title Scene**
- Introduce protagonist and premise
- 10-15 seconds
- Sets visual foundation
- Neutral or slightly positive emotion

**Scenes 1-5: Story Arc**
- Follow three-act structure
- 15-20 seconds each
- Total: 75-100 seconds of story
- Varied emotions for engagement

### Three-Act Structure

**Act 1 - Setup (Scenes 0-1):**
- Introduce protagonist
- Establish normal world
- Present inciting incident

**Act 2 - Conflict (Scenes 2-4):**
- Character faces challenges
- Rising tension and obstacles
- Build toward climax

**Act 3 - Resolution (Scene 5):**
- Climax and resolution
- Character transformation
- Satisfying conclusion

## Example Story: Pyter's First Bug

A Python snake programmer encounters a real bug on his keyboard:

**Scene 0:** Meet Pyter, a Python snake who loves to code
**Scene 1:** Pyter coding happily, everything working smoothly
**Scene 2:** A tiny orange bug appears on the keyboard!
**Scene 3:** Pyter investigates the curious bug
**Scene 4:** Together they find and fix a code bug
**Scene 5:** Success! Bug becomes a helpful friend

**Generated Output:**
- 6 images (scene_000.png through scene_005.png)
- 6 audio files (scene_000.mp3 through scene_005.mp3)
- Final video: ~102 seconds, 12 MB, 1080x1080

## Customization

### Custom Style Locks

Define your own visual style:

```python
CUSTOM_STYLE = """
Aspect ratio: 1920×1080 (widescreen)
Camera: 35mm lens, cinematic low angle
Lighting: dramatic rim lighting, 6500K cool tone
Color palette: #1A1A2E, #16213E, #E94560, #F39C12
Style: photorealistic with cinematic grading
"""
```

### Custom Characters

Create detailed character profiles:

```python
CHARACTER_LOCK = {
    "Luna": """
        Species: black cat
        Colors: pure black (#000000), yellow eyes (#FFD700)
        Features: sleek body, alert ears, long tail
        Clothing: small astronaut helmet
        Size: typical housecat
        Style: semi-realistic cartoon
    """
}
```

### Custom Scene Count

Change from default 6 scenes:

```python
# Shorter story (4 scenes)
scenes = ["title", "problem", "solution", "success"]

# Longer story (10 scenes)
scenes = ["title"] + [f"scene_{i}" for i in range(1, 10)]
```

### Multi-Character Dialogue

Create conversations between characters:

```python
dialogue = [
    {
        "character": "Alex",
        "text": "I found a bug!",
        "emotion": "excited",
        "voice_id": "TxGEqnHWrfWFTfGW9XjX"  # Josh
    },
    {
        "character": "Sage",
        "text": "Let's debug it together.",
        "emotion": "calm",
        "voice_id": "MF3mGyEYCl7XYWbV9V6O"  # Elli
    }
]
```

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Story Planning

```python
# Define story premise, characters, and structure
story = {
    "title": "The Lost Star",
    "scenes": 6,
    "protagonist": "Mira, a curious child",
    "theme": "Courage and discovery"
}
```

### 2. Character Definition

```python
# Create character appearance locks
characters = {
    "Mira": {
        "appearance": "...",
        "voice_id": "EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL"
    }
}
```

### 3. Scene Generation

```python
# For each scene:
# - Generate image with style/character locks
# - Generate narrated audio with emotion
# - Reference previous scene for consistency
```

### 4. Video Assembly

```bash
# Automated with bash script
bash scripts/assemble_video.sh ./output final_video.mp4
```

### 5. Review and Iterate

```python
# Review output, adjust:
# - Narration text
# - Emotion tags
# - Character descriptions
# - Style parameters
```

## Best Practices

### Visual Consistency

1. **Use hex codes for colors** - Prevents drift
2. **Reference previous scenes** - Maintains continuity
3. **Keep style descriptions detailed** - More control
4. **Test early** - Generate scenes 0-2 first to verify

### Narrative Quality

1. **Target 50-80 words per scene** - Natural pacing
2. **Vary emotion tags** - Keeps engaging
3. **Show don't tell** - Use visual descriptions
4. **End with resolution** - Satisfying conclusion

### Technical

1. **Verify ffmpeg installed** - Required for assembly
2. **Check API quotas** - Monitor usage limits
3. **Use appropriate models** - DALL-E 3 for quality, DALL-E 2 for consistency
4. **Keep output organized** - Separate directory per story

## Limitations and Considerations

### Image Generation

- DALL-E 3: Highest quality but harder to maintain consistency
- DALL-E 2: Better for variations but lower quality
- Gemini: Fast but may have quota limits

**Recommendation:** Use DALL-E 3 for Scene 0, then DALL-E 2 with variations for consistency.

### Audio Generation

- ElevenLabs free tier: 10,000 characters/month
- Music generation requires paid subscription
- Voice cloning requires paid tier

### Video Assembly

- ffmpeg required (must be installed separately)
- Processing time: ~30-60 seconds for 6-scene video
- File size: ~10-15 MB typical for 100-second video

## Troubleshooting

### Images Look Different Between Scenes

**Problem:** Character appearance changes scene to scene

**Solution:**
- Make CHARACTER_LOCK more specific
- Add exact hex codes for all colors
- Use image variations (DALL-E 2) referencing Scene 0
- Check that previous scene reference is working

### Audio Doesn't Match Video Length

**Problem:** Narration too long or too short

**Solution:**
- Target 50-80 words per scene
- Video auto-adjusts timing to match total audio
- Check that all audio files generated successfully

### Video Assembly Fails

**Problem:** ffmpeg errors or missing files

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify ffmpeg installed
ffmpeg -version

# Check all files present
ls output/scene_*.png
ls output/scene_*.mp3

# Verify file naming: scene_000.png not scene_0.png
```

### Poor Visual Quality

**Problem:** Images look low quality or pixelated

**Solution:**
- Use DALL-E 3 instead of DALL-E 2
- Ensure 1024x1024 or 1080x1080 generation
- Check ffmpeg CRF setting (lower = better quality)

## Performance Tips

### Faster Generation

- Use DALL-E 2 (faster than DALL-E 3)
- Use Flash v2.5 for audio (faster than Multilingual v2)
- Generate fewer scenes for testing

### Cost Optimization

- Use DALL-E 2 ($0.02/image vs $0.04-$0.08 for DALL-E 3)
- Monitor ElevenLabs character usage
- Cache and reuse successful generations

### Quality Optimization

- Use DALL-E 3 for highest quality images
- Use Multilingual v2 for best audio quality
- Lower ffmpeg CRF to 18 for better video quality

## Pricing Reference

**OpenAI (DALL-E):**
- DALL-E 3 Standard: $0.040 per image (1024x1024)
- DALL-E 3 HD: $0.080 per image
- DALL-E 2: $0.020 per image

**6-scene story cost: $0.12-$0.48**

**ElevenLabs:**
