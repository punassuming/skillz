# Brainstorming & Ideation Facilitation Skill

Guide users through structured, productive brainstorming sessions using proven creativity frameworks and techniques.

## Quick Start Workflow

When a brainstorming request arrives, follow this flow:

1. **Understand**: Clarify the challenge, goal, or question
2. **Choose**: Select appropriate technique(s) based on context
3. **Diverge**: Generate many ideas without judgment
4. **Converge**: Evaluate and prioritize ideas
5. **Action**: Help translate selected ideas into next steps

## When to Use This Skill

Activate for requests involving:
- "Help me brainstorm..."
- "Generate ideas for..."
- "What are creative solutions to..."
- "I need alternatives to..."
- "Think of different ways to..."
- Breaking through creative blocks
- Exploring possibilities before decision-making
- Innovation workshops or ideation sessions

## Technique Selection Guide

Choose techniques based on the situation:

### SCAMPER
**Best for**: Product/service innovation, improving existing solutions
**When**: User has something concrete to modify or enhance
**Time**: 15-20 minutes for thorough exploration

### Six Thinking Hats
**Best for**: Complex decisions, exploring multiple perspectives
**When**: Need structured analysis from different angles
**Time**: 10-15 minutes, can be abbreviated to 3-4 hats

### Mind Mapping
**Best for**: Exploring connections, organizing thoughts, understanding scope
**When**: Topic is broad or user needs to see relationships
**Time**: 10-20 minutes depending on complexity

### Rapid Ideation
**Best for**: Breaking through blocks, generating quantity
**When**: User is stuck or needs many options quickly
**Time**: 5-10 minutes of intense generation

### Reverse Brainstorming
**Best for**: Identifying failure points, problem analysis
**When**: User can't see solutions but can imagine problems
**Time**: 10-15 minutes

### Constraint-Based Creativity
**Best for**: Forcing new perspectives, overcoming assumptions
**When**: Conventional thinking dominates, need fresh angles
**Time**: 5-10 minutes per constraint

## Core Techniques

### 1. SCAMPER Framework

Lead users through systematic idea generation by asking:

**Substitute**: What can be replaced? Different materials, processes, people, or components?
- "What if we substituted X with Y?"
- "Who else could do this instead?"
- "What other ingredients/materials/approaches could work?"

**Combine**: What can be merged? Blend ideas, purposes, or features?
- "What if we combined this with that?"
- "How can we integrate these two aspects?"
- "What happens if we merge these processes?"

**Adapt**: What can be adjusted? Borrow from other contexts or industries?
- "What else is like this that we could learn from?"
- "How do other industries solve similar problems?"
- "What could we copy and adapt?"

**Modify/Magnify/Minify**: What can be changed in size, shape, or attributes?
- "What if this were bigger/smaller?"
- "What if we exaggerated this feature?"
- "What could we minimize or emphasize?"

**Put to another use**: What are alternative applications?
- "Who else could use this?"
- "What other problems could this solve?"
- "How could this be repurposed?"

**Eliminate**: What can be removed or simplified?
- "What if we removed this entirely?"
- "What's not essential?"
- "How can we simplify this?"

**Reverse/Rearrange**: What can be inverted or reordered?
- "What if we did this backwards?"
- "What if we reversed the sequence?"
- "What's the opposite approach?"

**Facilitation approach**: Go through each letter systematically, generating 2-5 ideas per category. Build on previous ideas.

### 2. Six Thinking Hats

Guide users to explore ideas from six distinct perspectives:

**White Hat** (Facts & Information): What do we know? What data do we need?
- Focus on objective information, data, facts
- "What are the facts here?"
- "What information is missing?"

**Red Hat** (Emotions & Intuition): What's your gut feeling? Emotional responses?
- Express feelings without justification
- "How do I feel about this?"
- "What's my intuition saying?"

**Black Hat** (Critical Judgment): What could go wrong? What are the risks?
- Identify weaknesses, risks, obstacles
- "What are the downsides?"
- "Why might this fail?"

**Yellow Hat** (Optimism & Benefits): What are the positives? Why might this work?
- Explore benefits, best-case scenarios
- "What are the advantages?"
- "Why is this valuable?"

**Green Hat** (Creativity & Alternatives): What are new possibilities? How can we innovate?
- Generate alternatives, think laterally
- "What else could we try?"
- "What's a completely different approach?"

**Blue Hat** (Process Control): What's our process? What have we learned?
- Manage thinking process, summarize
- "Where are we in the process?"
- "What's our next step?"

**Facilitation approach**: Spend 2-3 minutes per hat. Can combine or skip hats based on needs. Always end with Blue Hat for summary.

### 3. Mind Mapping

Structure exploration visually and associatively:

1. **Central Topic**: Start with the core question or challenge in the center
2. **Main Branches**: Create 4-7 primary branches for major themes
3. **Sub-branches**: Extend each main branch with related concepts
4. **Connections**: Draw links between related ideas across branches
5. **Keywords**: Use single words or short phrases, not sentences

**Facilitation approach**:
- Help user identify central topic
- Suggest main branch categories
- Encourage free association on sub-branches
- Point out potential connections
- Can represent textually using indentation and bullet points

### 4. Rapid Ideation

Generate maximum quantity in minimum time:

**Process**:
1. Set clear target: "Let's generate 30 ideas in 10 minutes"
2. State challenge as "How might we..." question
3. Rapid-fire idea generation with NO evaluation
4. Push past obvious ideas (ideas 15-30 are often most creative)
5. Use prompts when user slows down

**Rules**:
- Defer ALL judgment
- Quantity over quality
- Build on others' ideas
- Wild ideas encouraged
- Stay focused on topic

**Facilitation approach**: Keep pace fast, offer prompts when user pauses, count ideas to track progress, celebrate hitting targets.

### 5. Reverse Brainstorming

Invert the problem to unlock solutions:

**Process**:
1. Flip the goal: "How could we CAUSE this problem?" or "How could we make this WORSE?"
2. Generate many ways to create the problem
3. Reverse each "bad" idea into a potential solution
4. Evaluate reversed solutions

**Example**:
- Goal: "Improve customer satisfaction"
- Reversed: "How could we make customers hate us?"
- Bad ideas: "Ignore complaints, slow response time, hidden fees"
- Solutions: "Respond quickly to complaints, transparent pricing, proactive communication"

**Facilitation approach**: Make the reversal fun and extreme. Encourage absurd "bad" ideas. Then carefully reverse each one.

### 6. Constraint-Based Creativity

Use limitations to spark innovation:

**Common Constraints**:
- **Zero Budget**: "What if you had no money at all?"
- **Extreme Time**: "What if you had to do this in 24 hours?"
- **No Technology**: "What if you had to solve this without computers?"
- **10x Scale**: "What if you had to serve 10x more people?"
- **Opposite Users**: "How would a child/elderly person/expert approach this?"
- **Different Context**: "How would [company/industry] solve this?"

**Process**:
1. Apply constraint clearly and dramatically
2. Force solutions within that constraint
3. Identify interesting ideas that emerge
4. Relax constraint and keep the insights

**Facilitation approach**: Choose constraint based on what assumptions need breaking. Push user to fully commit to the constraint.

## Facilitation Principles

Apply these throughout all techniques:

1. **Defer Judgment**: Separate generation from evaluation
2. **Quantity First**: More ideas = more good ideas
3. **Build and Combine**: Use "Yes, and..." not "Yes, but..."
4. **Encourage Wild Ideas**: Unusual ideas can lead to practical ones
5. **Visual Thinking**: Use diagrams, sketches, spatial organization
6. **Time Boxing**: Set clear time limits for each phase
7. **Capture Everything**: Write down all ideas, even "bad" ones
8. **Energy Management**: Match technique intensity to user energy
9. **Psychological Safety**: Make it safe to suggest anything
10. **Mix Techniques**: Combine methods for richer results

## Diverge → Converge Process

### Divergent Phase (Generate)
- Maximize quantity
- Suspend evaluation
- Welcome wild ideas
- Build on everything
- Go for variety

### Convergent Phase (Evaluate)
- Group similar ideas
- Identify patterns
- Apply criteria
- Narrow options
- Make decisions

**Don't mix these phases!** Complete divergence before converging.

## Evaluation & Prioritization

When ready to narrow ideas (see `references/evaluation-frameworks.md` for details):

### Quick Filters
- **Gut Check**: Which ideas excite you most?
- **Impact vs Effort**: High impact, low effort = do first
- **Must/Should/Could**: Categorize by necessity
- **Three Stars**: Each person picks top 3

### Structured Methods
- **Weighted Criteria**: Score ideas on key factors
- **Impact/Effort Matrix**: 2x2 grid placement
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Can we actually do this?
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong?

## Common Patterns & Adaptations

**For individual brainstorming**: Focus on mind mapping, SCAMPER, and constraint-based methods

**For group facilitation**: Use Six Hats for structure, rapid ideation for energy, reverse brainstorming for engagement

**For technical problems**: SCAMPER and constraint-based work well

**For strategic decisions**: Six Thinking Hats provides comprehensive analysis

**For creative blocks**: Rapid ideation, reverse brainstorming, or random prompts break through resistance

**For innovation**: Combine SCAMPER with constraint-based creativity

## Session Structure Template

For a complete brainstorming session:

1. **Setup** (2-3 minutes)
   - Clarify the challenge
   - Set goals: "How many ideas?" "What decision?"
   - Choose technique(s)

2. **Warm-up** (2-3 minutes, optional)
   - Quick creative prompt to loosen thinking
   - Example: "Name 20 uses for a brick"

3. **Main Generation** (10-20 minutes)
   - Apply chosen technique(s)
   - Generate without judgment
   - Push past obvious ideas

4. **Capture & Organize** (3-5 minutes)
   - Group similar ideas
   - Identify themes
   - Count what you have

5. **Evaluation** (5-10 minutes)
   - Apply chosen criteria
   - Narrow to top candidates
   - Flag ideas needing development

6. **Next Steps** (2-3 minutes)
   - Choose 1-3 ideas to pursue
   - Define immediate actions
   - Schedule follow-up if needed

## Adapting to Context

**Time-constrained**: Use rapid ideation + quick gut check evaluation

**Well-defined problem**: SCAMPER for depth

**Ambiguous situation**: Mind mapping to understand, then choose technique

**Group conflict**: Six Hats for structured perspective-taking

**Innovation pressure**: Constraint-based + reverse brainstorming

**Decision paralysis**: Rapid ideation to get unstuck, then Impact/Effort matrix

## Tips for Effective Facilitation

- **Start with clarity**: Reframe vague requests into "How might we..." questions
- **Match energy**: High-energy techniques for engagement, structured for focus
- **Use silence**: Let user think; don't fill every pause
- **Build momentum**: Start with easier prompts, increase difficulty
- **Celebrate quantity**: Count ideas, celebrate milestones
- **Avoid premature convergence**: Keep generating even when "good enough" ideas appear
- **Document visually**: Use formatting, bullets, numbering, grouping
- **End with action**: Always conclude with concrete next steps

## Example Trigger Responses

When user says: **"Help me brainstorm ideas for a new feature"**
→ Clarify goal → Suggest SCAMPER for feature enhancement → Generate systematically → Evaluate with Impact/Effort

When user says: **"I'm stuck on how to solve X"**
→ Try reverse brainstorming → "How could we make X worse?" → Generate problems → Flip to solutions

When user says: **"Give me creative alternatives to Y"**
→ Use constraint-based creativity → Apply unusual constraints → Generate within limits → Relax and refine

When user says: **"What are all the angles on this decision?"**
→ Six Thinking Hats → Go through each perspective → Summarize with Blue Hat → Support decision

## Output Format Suggestions

Present ideas in clear, scannable formats:

**For Generation Phase**:
```
IDEA 1: [Title]
→ Brief description

IDEA 2: [Title]
→ Brief description
```

**For Grouped Ideas**:
```
CATEGORY A: [Theme]
• Idea 1
• Idea 2
• Idea 3

CATEGORY B: [Theme]
• Idea 4
• Idea 5
```

**For Evaluated Ideas**:
```
HIGH PRIORITY:
✓ Idea X - High impact, low effort
✓ Idea Y - Solves core problem

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
○ Idea Z - Good potential, needs research

PARKING LOT:
◇ Idea W - Interesting but not now
```

## Closing a Session

Before ending a brainstorming session:

1. **Summarize**: Recap what was generated
2. **Highlight**: Call out most promising ideas
3. **Capture decisions**: Document what user chose to pursue
4. **Define actions**: Clear next steps with owners
5. **Appreciate creativity**: Acknowledge the thinking work done
