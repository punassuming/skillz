- Process optimization

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Preparation
- Clearly identify what you're trying to improve
- Have description/details readily available
- Set aside 15-20 minutes
- Prepare to record all ideas

#### 2. Substitute

**Questions to ask:**
- What materials or resources can you substitute?
- What other process could you use?
- What rules could you change?
- Can you use this somewhere else?
- Can you change the tone or attitude?
- What if you substituted people involved?

**Example prompts:**
- "What if we used [X] instead of [Y]?"
- "Who else could deliver this?"

- What parallel situation exists?

**Example prompts:**
- "How does [other industry] solve this?"
- "What if we applied [different context] thinking?"
- "Who does something similar that we could learn from?"
- "What would [successful company] do?"

**Generate 3-5 ideas before moving on.**

#### 5. Modify/Magnify/Minify

**Questions to ask:**
- What can you exaggerate?
- What can you make smaller?
- What can you add?
- What can you make more frequent?
- What can you strengthen or weaken?

**Generate 3-5 ideas before moving on.**

#### 6. Put to Another Use

**Questions to ask:**
- What else can this be used for?
- Can this serve other purposes as-is?
- Who else could use this?
- What if this were in a different market?
- What other problems does this solve?

**Example prompts:**
- "What if [different user type] used this?"
- "What other problems does this solve?"
- "Where else could this work?"
- "What if we repositioned this entirely?"

**Generate 3-5 ideas before moving on.**

#### 7. Eliminate

**Questions to ask:**
- What can you remove?
- What's not necessary?
- What if you simplified this?
- What if you split this into parts?
- Can you streamline this?

**Example prompts:**
- "What if we removed [feature]?"
- "What's the minimum viable version?"
- "What would happen if this didn't exist?"
- "Can we make this simpler?"

**Generate 3-5 ideas before moving on.**

#### 8. Reverse/Rearrange

**Questions to ask:**
- What if you did this backwards?
- Can you reverse roles?
- Can you reverse positive and negative?
- What if you tried the opposite?
- Can you rearrange the sequence?
- Can you change the layout?

**Example prompts:**
- "What if customers did what we do?"
- "What if we started at the end?"
- "What's the complete opposite approach?"
- "What if we did this backwards?"

**Generate 3-5 ideas before moving on.**

### Facilitation Tips

- **Don't skip categories**: Even if some seem irrelevant, try them
- **Build combinations**: Combine ideas from different SCAMPER categories
- **Go extreme**: Exaggerate modifications to spark ideas
- **Document everything**: Even "bad" ideas can trigger good ones
- **Use examples**: Reference real products that demonstrate each technique

### Example Session

**Challenge**: Improve a coffee subscription service

**Substitute**:
- Use local roasters instead of centralized warehouse
- Substitute bags with reusable containers
- Replace monthly with daily micro-deliveries

**Combine**:
- Merge coffee subscription with brewing tutorials

## Six Thinking Hats

### Overview
Structured parallel thinking technique that explores ideas from six distinct perspectives, minimizing conflict and ensuring comprehensive analysis.

### When to Use
- Complex decisions requiring multiple viewpoints
- Group discussions with diverse opinions
- When analysis feels one-sided
- Strategic planning sessions
- Conflict resolution

### The Six Hats

**White Hat** (Objective Facts)
- Focus: Information, data, facts, figures
- Mindset: Neutral, objective
- No opinions or interpretations

**Red Hat** (Emotions & Intuition)
- Focus: Feelings, hunches, gut reactions
- Mindset: Emotional, intuitive
- No justification needed

**Black Hat** (Critical Judgment)
- Focus: Risks, problems, reasons it won't work
- Mindset: Cautious, critical
- Identify weaknesses

**Yellow Hat** (Optimistic)
- Focus: Benefits, best case, why it will work
- Mindset: Positive, constructive
- Identify strengths

**Green Hat** (Creative)
- Focus: New ideas, alternatives, possibilities
- Mindset: Innovative, generative
- Think laterally

**Blue Hat** (Process Control)
- Focus: Process, organization, next steps
- Mindset: Meta-level, orchestrating
- Manage the thinking

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Full Session (30-40 minutes)

**1. Blue Hat Opening (3 minutes)**
- Define the topic clearly
- Set goals for the session
- Agree on hat sequence
- Establish time limits

**2. White Hat (5 minutes)**
Questions to explore:
- What do we know?
- What information do we have?
- What data is missing?
- What are the facts?
- What can we observe?

Output: Clear factual foundation

**3. Red Hat (3 minutes)**
Questions to explore:
- How do I feel about this?
- What's my gut reaction?
- What are my concerns?
- What excites me?
- What's my intuition?

**Important**: No justification needed!

Output: Emotional landscape revealed

**4. Yellow Hat (5 minutes)**
Questions to explore:
- What are the benefits?
- Why will this work?
- What's the best outcome?
- What opportunities exist?
- What value does this create?

Output: Optimistic assessment

**5. Black Hat (5 minutes)**
Questions to explore:
- What could go wrong?
- What are the risks?
- Why might this fail?
- What are the weaknesses?
- What problems exist?

Output: Risk assessment

**6. Green Hat (8 minutes)**
Questions to explore:
- What are alternatives?
- How can we modify this?
- What's a different approach?
- What if we tried...?
- What new ideas emerge?

Output: Creative alternatives

**7. Blue Hat Closing (3 minutes)**
- Summarize key points from each hat
- Identify actions and decisions
- Determine next steps
- Reflect on the process

#### Abbreviated Session (15 minutes)

Use just 3-4 hats based on needs:

**For quick decision**:
- White (facts) → Yellow (pros) → Black (cons) → Blue (decision)

**For creative exploration**:
- White (facts) → Red (feelings) → Green (ideas) → Blue (next steps)

**For problem analysis**:
- White (facts) → Black (problems) → Green (solutions) → Blue (action)

### Facilitation Tips

**Enforce the hats**: Keep thinking aligned with current hat
- Stop Yellow thinking during Black hat
- Defer criticism during Green hat
- Save process discussion for Blue hat

**Use visual cues**: Literally reference the hat colors
- "Put on your Black Hat now"
- "This sounds like Red Hat thinking"

**Time-box strictly**: Move forward even if discussion continues

**Record by hat**: Organize notes under each hat heading

**Start easy**: Begin with White or Red Hat for engagement

**End with Blue**: Always conclude with summary and action

**Watch energy**: Place demanding hats (Black, Green) mid-session

### Common Patterns

**Decision-Making Sequence**:
Blue → White → Red → Yellow → Black → Green → Blue

**Creative Sequence**:
Blue → White → Green → Yellow → Black → Blue

**Problem-Solving Sequence**:
Blue → White → Black → Green → Yellow → Blue

**Quick Check-In Sequence**:
White → Yellow → Black → Blue

### Example Session

**Topic**: Should we launch a new product line?

**Blue Opening**: "We'll spend 25 minutes exploring this decision using all six hats, 4 minutes each, to reach a recommendation."

## Mind Mapping

### Overview
Visual brainstorming technique that mimics how the brain makes associations, using hierarchical structure radiating from a central concept.

### When to Use
- Exploring a broad topic
- Understanding complex relationships
- Organizing scattered thoughts
- Planning projects
- Note-taking during ideation
- Breaking down large concepts

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Setup (2 minutes)

**Start with central image/topic**:
- Place main topic in center
- Use a word or simple phrase
- Can represent visually in text using formatting

Example format:
```
                    [CENTRAL TOPIC]
```

#### 2. Create Main Branches (5 minutes)

**Identify 4-7 primary themes**:
- What are the major categories?
- What are the key aspects?
- What are the main questions?

Add as major branches from center:
```
        Theme A
            ↓
[CENTRAL TOPIC] ← Theme B
            ↓
        Theme C
```

**Tips for main branches**:
- Use single words or short phrases
- Make them distinct categories
- Aim for 5-7 branches
- Use parallel structure if possible

#### 3. Add Sub-Branches (10 minutes)

**Extend each main branch**:
- What details relate to this theme?
- What examples fit here?
- What questions arise?
- What associations emerge?

Example expansion:
```
Theme A
├── Detail 1
├── Detail 2
│   ├── Sub-detail A
│   └── Sub-detail B
└── Detail 3
```

**Keep going deeper**:
- Each idea can branch further
- Follow associations naturally
- Don't force structure
- Let ideas flow

#### 4. Make Connections (5 minutes)

**Link related ideas across branches**:
- Which ideas relate to each other?
- What patterns emerge?
- What unexpected connections exist?

Can show connections through:
- Cross-references
- Grouped items
- Noted relationships

#### 5. Review and Refine (3 minutes)

**Step back and analyze**:
- What themes dominate?
- What's missing?
- What surprised you?
- What's the overall picture?

### Text-Based Mind Map Format

Since visual tools may not be available, represent mind maps hierarchically:

```markdown
# CENTRAL TOPIC

## Main Branch 1
- Sub-branch 1A
  - Detail 1A-i
  - Detail 1A-ii
- Sub-branch 1B
- Sub-branch 1C

## Main Branch 2
- Sub-branch 2A
- Sub-branch 2B
  - Detail 2B-i
  - Detail 2B-ii
  - Detail 2B-iii

## Main Branch 3
- Sub-branch 3A
- Sub-branch 3B

[Connection: 1A-ii ↔ 2B-i]
[Connection: 1C ↔ 3A]
```

### Facilitation Tips

**Start broad**: Main branches first, then details

**Use keywords**: Single words better than sentences

**Embrace chaos**: Not all branches will be equal

**Add freely**: Refine structure later

**Use visual elements**: Colors, symbols, emphasis when possible

**Follow energy**: Develop interesting branches more deeply

**Look for patterns**: Group and reorganize as needed

**Don't force symmetry**: Natural growth varies

## Rapid Ideation

### Overview
High-intensity, time-boxed technique focused on generating maximum quantity of ideas in minimum time.

### When to Use
- Breaking through creative blocks
- Need many options quickly
- User is stuck or overthinking
- Want to exhaust obvious ideas
- Building momentum
- Warm-up exercise

### Core Principles

1. **Quantity over quality**: More is better
2. **Speed beats perfection**: Don't refine, just generate
3. **No judgment**: Evaluation comes later
4. **Build momentum**: Keep the flow going
5. **Push past obvious**: Best ideas come after easy ones

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Setup (1 minute)

**Frame the challenge**:
- Use "How might we..." format
- Make it specific enough to focus
- Keep it broad enough for variety

**Set the target**:
- "Let's generate 20 ideas in 8 minutes"
- "Aim for 30 ideas in 10 minutes"
- "Try for one idea every 30 seconds"

**Establish rules**:
- No evaluation or criticism
- Capture everything
- Build on ideas
- Stay on topic

#### 2. Generate (5-15 minutes)

**Start fast**:
- Take first ideas that come
- Don't overthink
- Write short phrases
- Number each idea

**Maintain pace**:
- If user slows, offer prompts
- Count ideas aloud
- Celebrate milestones
- Push for more

**Use prompts when stuck**:
- "What if you combined ideas?"
- "What's the opposite of that?"
- "What would [expert/company] do?"
- "Make the last idea bigger/smaller"
- "What if you had to do this tomorrow?"

**Push past the obvious** (ideas 1-10 tend to be conventional):
- Ideas 11-20: Getting interesting
- Ideas 21-30: Often most creative
- Keep going past targets

#### 3. Quick Capture (2 minutes)

**Review what was generated**:
- Count total ideas
- Group obvious clusters
- Flag standouts

**Don't evaluate yet**: Just organize

### Variations

#### Lightning Round
- 1 minute
- As many ideas as possible
- Anything goes
- Warm-up exercise

#### Quotas
- Must generate 20/30/50 ideas
- No time limit
- Focus on hitting number
- Can't stop until quota met

#### Building Chains
- Start with one idea
- Each new idea builds on previous
- Create idea chain
- 10-15 ideas in sequence

#### Category Sprints
- Set category (e.g., "low cost")
- Generate ideas in that category (5 min)
- Switch category
- Repeat 3-4 times

### Prompt Library for Momentum

**When user slows down:**
- "What would a child suggest?"
- "What's a completely impractical version?"
- "What if you had unlimited budget?"
- "What if you had zero budget?"
- "How would your competitor do this?"
- "What's the exact opposite?"
- "What if you combined two previous ideas?"
- "Make the last idea 10x bigger"
- "What if this had to work in 24 hours?"

### Facilitation Tips

**Count ideas**: "That's 12! Halfway there!"

**Celebrate progress**: "Great! Keep going!"

**Don't let pauses linger**: Offer prompt within 10 seconds

**Build energy**: Show enthusiasm

**Challenge targets**: "I bet we can hit 25!"

**No evaluation words**: Avoid "good/bad/interesting"

**Keep capturing**: Write everything down

**Push quantity**: When user says "that's enough," push for 5 more

### Example Session

**Challenge**: How might we increase customer engagement?

**Target**: 25 ideas in 10 minutes

## Reverse Brainstorming

### Overview
Creative problem-solving technique that inverts the problem to generate solutions by first identifying how to cause or worsen the problem, then reversing those ideas.

### When to Use
- Conventional thinking not working
- Need fresh perspective
- Identifying failure points
- Risk analysis
- When "what to do" is hard but "what not to do" is clear
- Making problem-solving more engaging

### Why It Works

- **Easier to criticize than create**: Naturally good at finding problems
- **Less psychological resistance**: Fun to think negatively
- **Reveals hidden assumptions**: Exposes what we take for granted
- **Uncovers blind spots**: Shows risks we didn't see

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Frame the Problem (2 minutes)

**Original goal**: State clearly
Example: "Improve customer satisfaction"

**Reversed goal**: Flip it completely
Example: "How could we make customers hate us?"

**Make it extreme**: Go negative
- "How do we guarantee failure?"
- "How do we create the worst experience?"
- "What would destroy trust completely?"

#### 2. Generate "Bad" Ideas (8-10 minutes)

**Brainstorm ways to achieve the negative goal**:
- Be specific
- Be dramatic
- Be creative with negativity
- Don't hold back

**Encourage extreme thinking**:
- "What's the most offensive thing we could do?"
- "How could we be maximally incompetent?"
- "What would a villain do?"

**Apply rapid ideation principles**:
- Generate 15-25 "bad" ideas
- No filtering
- Build on each other
- Get creative with awfulness

#### 3. Reverse Each Idea (8-10 minutes)

**Take each "bad" idea and flip it**:
- What's the opposite action?
- What would prevent this bad thing?
- How do we do the reverse?

**Transform into actionable solutions**:
- "Ignore complaints" → "Respond to every complaint within 1 hour"
- "Hide pricing" → "Transparent pricing on every page"
- "Make it complex" → "Simplify to 3 clicks or less"

#### 4. Evaluate Reversed Ideas (5 minutes)

**Which reversed ideas are**:
- Practical to implement?
- Addressing real risks?
- Novel or unexpected?
- High-impact?

**Prioritize the best solutions**

### Example Session

**Goal**: Improve employee retention

**Reversed Goal**: "How could we make employees quit as fast as possible?"

**"Bad" Ideas Generated**:
1. Never give feedback
2. Micromanage everything
3. Ignore work-life balance
4. Pay below market rate
5. Cancel all training
6. Play favorites
7. No career advancement
8. Terrible work environment
9. Unclear expectations
10. Take credit for their work
11. Schedule meetings constantly
12. Give no recognition
13. Eliminate flexibility
14. Poor communication
15. No purpose or mission
16. Outdated tools/technology
17. Toxic team culture
18. Ignore their ideas
19. No autonomy
20. Unpredictable schedule changes

**Reversed into Solutions**:
1. "Never give feedback" → **Regular 1:1s with constructive feedback**
2. "Micromanage everything" → **Trust and autonomy in their work**
3. "Ignore work-life balance" → **Flexible hours and WFH options**
4. "Pay below market rate" → **Competitive salary reviews**
5. "Cancel all training" → **Professional development budget**
6. "Play favorites" → **Transparent promotion criteria**
7. "No career advancement" → **Clear growth paths**
8. "Terrible work environment" → **Invest in workspace quality**
9. "Unclear expectations" → **Clear OKRs and goals**
10. "Take credit for their work" → **Public recognition programs**

**Top 5 Solutions Selected**:
- ✓ Regular 1:1s with feedback
- ✓ Flexible work arrangements
- ✓ Clear career advancement paths
- ✓ Professional development budgets
- ✓ Public recognition programs

### Facilitation Tips

**Make it fun**: Encourage absurdity in negative phase

**Go extreme**: "What's the WORST possible way?"

**Be specific**: "Hide pricing" is better than "be dishonest"

**Don't skip bad ideas**: Even obvious ones can yield insights

**Flip carefully**: Make sure reversal addresses the bad idea

**Look for patterns**: Multiple bad ideas might reverse to one solution

**Consider prevention**: "How do we ensure [bad thing] never happens?"

### Variations

#### Worst Case Scenario
- Imagine everything goes wrong
- List all failures
- Develop preventions

#### Competitor Attack Plan
- "How would a competitor hurt us?"
- Identify vulnerabilities
- Build defenses

#### Failure Analysis
- "Why will this project fail?"
- Generate failure modes
- Reverse into risk mitigations

## Constraint-Based Creativity

### Overview
Using limitations and constraints deliberately to force new perspectives and innovative thinking by breaking assumptions.

### When to Use
- Stuck in conventional thinking
- Need radical innovation
- Want to challenge assumptions
- Seeking differentiation
- Breaking mental models
- Making brainstorming more focused

### Why Constraints Work

- **Force new patterns**: Can't use default solutions
- **Break assumptions**: Reveal what we take for granted
- **Increase creativity**: Limitations spark innovation
- **Focus thinking**: Narrower scope = deeper exploration
- **Reveal priorities**: Shows what matters most

### Types of Constraints

#### 1. Resource Constraints

**Zero Budget**
- "What if you had no money at all?"
- Forces creative use of existing resources
- Reveals expensive assumptions

Example: "Design a marketing campaign with $0 budget"
→ User-generated content, guerrilla marketing, organic social

**Time Constraints**
- "What if you had to launch tomorrow?"
- "What if this had to last 100 years?"
- Forces prioritization and simplicity

Example: "Build MVP in 48 hours"
→ Minimal features, existing tools, manual processes

**People Constraints**
- "What if you had to do this alone?"
- "What if you had unlimited people?"
- Reveals scaling issues

Example: "What if only one person could handle this?"
→ Automation, documentation, streamlining

#### 2. Capability Constraints

**No Technology**
- "What if computers didn't exist?"
- Focuses on fundamentals

Example: "Solve without software"
→ Paper systems, human processes, physical solutions

**No Communication**
- "What if you couldn't talk to customers?"
- Forces empathy and research

Example: "Design without user research"
→ Observe behavior, analyze data, test assumptions

**Specific Tool Only**
- "Using only [specific technology]"
- Forces mastery of constraints

Example: "Using only email"
→ Newsletter strategies, drip campaigns, automation

#### 3. Scale Constraints

**10x Larger**
- "What if you had to serve 10x more people?"
- Forces scalability thinking

Example: "10x traffic tomorrow"
→ Architecture changes, automation, simplified flows

**10x Smaller**
- "What if you served 1/10th the audience?"
- Forces niche thinking

Example: "Only 100 customers"
→ High-touch service, premium positioning, exclusivity

**Single Unit**
- "What if you could only make one?"
- Forces quality focus

Example: "Only one product"
→ Perfection focus, customization, luxury positioning

#### 4. User Constraints

**Different User**
- "How would a [user type] use this?"
- Forces perspective shift

Examples:
- "How would a child use this?" → Simplify
- "How would an expert use this?" → Power features
- "How would someone with no time use this?" → Efficiency
- "How would someone skeptical use this?" → Overcome objections

**Extreme Needs**
- "Design for someone who..."
- Forces accessibility thinking

Examples:
- "...can't see" → Voice/audio interfaces
- "...can't use their hands" → Alternative inputs
- "...doesn't speak the language" → Visual design

#### 5. Industry Constraints

**Different Industry**
- "How would [industry] solve this?"
- Cross-pollination of ideas

Examples:
- "How would Disney handle customer service?"
- "How would Tesla approach manufacturing?"
- "How would Netflix do recommendations?"

**Banned Solutions**
- "You can't use [common solution]"
- Forces alternatives

Example: "Can't use email for notifications"
→ SMS, push, in-app, phone calls, physical mail

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Choose Constraint (2 minutes)

**Select based on**:
- What assumption needs breaking?
- What's limiting current thinking?
- What would create freshest perspective?

**Make it clear and extreme**: Don't hedge

#### 2. Apply Constraint Fully (10-15 minutes)

**Enforce the constraint strictly**:
- Remind user of limitation
- Block default solutions
- Push for compliance

**Generate 10-15 ideas within constraint**:
- How would this work?
- What becomes possible?
- What workarounds exist?

**Use prompts**:
- "Yes, but remember, you have [constraint]"
- "How would that work without [resource]?"
- "Push further into the constraint"

#### 3. Identify Insights (5 minutes)

**What did the constraint reveal**:
- What assumptions were broken?
- What unexpected ideas emerged?
- What actually matters?
- What's surprisingly possible?

#### 4. Relax Constraint (5 minutes)

**Bring back removed resources, but keep insights**:
- Which constrained ideas still work?
- How can we keep the innovation?
- What principles transfer?

**Cherry-pick the best**: Keep breakthroughs, restore practicality

### Example Session

**Challenge**: Improve online course completion rates

**Constraint Applied**: "What if students had no internet access after purchasing?"

**Ideas Generated**:
1. Download all materials upfront
2. Offline app with syncing
3. Physical workbook companion
4. USB drive with complete course
5. Printable versions of everything
6. Audio-only version for offline listening
7. Mobile app with offline mode

**Insights from Constraint**:
- Completion is about having materials when needed, not just access
- Synchronous learning assumptions are limiting
- Physical components could enhance engagement
- Offline capability is actually valuable

**Ideas Kept After Relaxing Constraint**:
- ✓ Offline-first app design (works online or offline)
- ✓ Downloadable workbooks (adds value)
- ✓ Audio versions for commuting (accessibility)
- ✓ Physical certificate (tangible achievement)
- ✓ Text message reminders (simple tech)

### Facilitation Tips

**Choose dramatic constraints**: "No budget" not "small budget"

**Enforce strictly**: Don't let user cheat constraint

**Push deeper**: "Really commit to this limitation"

**Celebrate creativity**: Recognize clever workarounds

**Look for insights**: What does this reveal?

**Don't discard**: Constrained ideas may be viable

**Combine constraints**: Stack multiple for more pressure

**Time-box**: Don't stay constrained too long (10-15 min max)

### Constraint Combinations

**Power combos**:
- Zero budget + 24 hours
- No technology + 10x scale
- Different user + no communication
- Single unit + no technology

**Process**:
1. Apply first constraint (10 min)
2. Add second constraint (5 min)
3. See what survives both
4. Extract insights

### Common Constraint Prompts

**Resource**:
- "Zero budget, unlimited time"
- "Unlimited budget, only 1 day"
- "No employees, only contractors"
- "No software, only people"

**Scale**:
- "10x users tomorrow"
- "Only 10 users ever"
- "Global from day one"
- "One city only"

**User**:
- "Only for children under 10"
- "Only for people over 80"
- "Only for experts"
- "Only for complete beginners"

**Industry**:
- "As a restaurant would"
- "As a hospital would"
- "As a game company would"
- "As a nonprofit would"

**Capability**:
- "No internet"
- "No electricity"
- "No written language"
- "Using only voice"

## Additional Techniques

### The 5 Whys

**Purpose**: Root cause analysis

**Process**:
1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why does this happen?"
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Repeat 5 times
5. You'll reach root cause

**Best for**: Understanding problems before solving them

### Worst Possible Idea

**Purpose**: Creative warm-up, break tension

**Process**:
1. Generate intentionally terrible ideas
2. Laugh together
3. Flip the worst ideas into good ones
4. Use as springboard

**Best for**: Warming up, breaking creative blocks

### Random Word Association

**Purpose**: Force unexpected connections

**Process**:
1. Choose random word (use script in /scripts)
2. Connect it to your challenge
3. Generate ideas from connection

Example: Challenge = "improve meetings"
Random word: "Garden"
Ideas: Plant seeds of ideas, prune bad topics, cultivate discussion, harvest actions

**Best for**: Breaking conventional patterns

### Analogies and Metaphors

**Purpose**: Transfer solutions across domains

**Process**:
1. "This is like..."
2. Complete the analogy
3. Explore how that works
4. Transfer insights back

Example: "Customer onboarding is like..."
- "...a first date" → Make good impression, don't overwhelm
- "...a flight" → Clear instructions, safety first, comfortable
- "...a theme park" → Exciting, guided, memorable

**Best for**: Complex or abstract challenges

### Forced Connections

**Purpose**: Combine unrelated concepts

**Process**:
1. List 5-10 random items
2. Force connection between item and challenge
3. Generate ideas from connections

Example: Challenge = "team collaboration"
Random items: Pizza, telescope, river, compass, orchestra
Ideas:
- Pizza → Shared resources, delivering value in slices
- Telescope → Clear vision, focus on distant goals
- River → Flow of information, remove obstacles
- Compass → Aligned direction, navigation
- Orchestra → Coordination, different roles harmonizing

**Best for**: Innovation, creative connections

### Future Scenarios

**Purpose**: Explore possibilities through time travel

**Process**:
1. Jump to future (6 months, 5 years, 20 years)
2. Describe what success looks like then
3. Work backward to present
4. Identify steps to get there

**Best for**: Strategic planning, vision setting
