## Using Prompts Effectively

### Selection Strategies

**Random**: Pick any prompt, force a connection
- Best when completely stuck
- Trust the randomness

**Targeted**: Choose category based on need
- Break specific assumptions
- Address known gaps

**Sequential**: Work through prompts systematically
- Comprehensive exploration
- Good for important decisions

**Combination**: Apply multiple prompts
- "What if this served 5-year-olds AND had zero budget?"
- Creates compound constraints

### Facilitation Tips

**Give it time**: Spend 3-5 minutes per prompt
- Don't rush past discomfort
- Best ideas come after initial awkwardness

**Force the connection**: No "that doesn't apply"
- Everything connects somehow
- Weird connections = insights

**Capture everything**: Write down all ideas
- Even ideas that don't work
- Spark other ideas later

**Build on prompts**: Use generated ideas as new prompts
- Recursive creativity
- Compound insights

**Mix modalities**: Combine prompt types
- Constraint + Perspective
- Scale + Emotion
- Removal + Industry

### Sample Sequences

**For innovation**:
1. Industry Transfer prompt
2. Scale prompt
3. Removal prompt
4. Emotional prompt

**For problem-solving**:
1. Perspective prompt
2. Reversal prompt
3. Constraint prompt
4. Time manipulation prompt

**For quick spark**:

## Advanced Prompt Techniques

### Prompt Chaining

Apply prompts in sequence, building on each answer:

1. Start: "How might we improve customer onboarding?"
2. Prompt 1: "What if you had zero budget?" → Use only existing resources
3. Prompt 2: "How would a 5-year-old approach this?" → Make it simpler
4. Result: "Create a 3-step welcome with existing UI that feels like a game"

### Prompt Layering

Apply multiple prompts simultaneously:

**Challenge**: Improve team meetings
**Layer 1**: "What if meetings were 10x shorter?" (Time)
**Layer 2**: "How would a theme park design this?" (Industry)
**Layer 3**: "What if there were no talking?" (Removal)
**Result**: "5-minute visual updates using interactive displays"

### Prompt Mutations

Evolve prompts as you work:
- Start broad, get specific
- Start extreme, moderate
- Start silly, get serious
- Start constrained, relax

---

**Remember**: The most valuable prompts are the ones that make you uncomfortable. Discomfort means you're breaking assumptions, which is where innovation lives.
