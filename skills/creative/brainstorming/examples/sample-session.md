Example of a complete brainstorming session using the brainstorming skill.

**Participant**: Product Manager
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Techniques Used**: Rapid Ideation → Impact/Effort Matrix

---

## Session Transcript

### 1. Setup & Understanding (3 minutes)

**Claude**: Let's brainstorm ideas to improve customer retention. First, let me understand the context:

- What's your current retention rate?
- When do most customers churn?
- What have you tried already?

**User**: About 70% annual retention. Most churn happens in the first 90 days. We've tried email campaigns and basic onboarding tutorials.

**Claude**: Got it. So we're focusing on early-stage retention (first 90 days) to get customers past that critical period. Let's aim to generate 30 ideas in the next 12 minutes using Rapid Ideation. No evaluation yet - just pure generation. Ready?

**User**: Yes!

### 2. Divergent Phase - Rapid Ideation (12 minutes)

2. Weekly check-in calls from success team
3. In-app progress tracking/milestones
4. Customer success playbooks by industry
5. Automated feature adoption tracking
6. "Power user" fast-track onboarding
7. Peer community/forum for questions
8. Live weekly training webinars

**User**: Wow, when grouped like that, I see we need a mix of automation AND high-touch. The cohort-based learning is interesting - I hadn't thought of that.

**Claude**: Exactly! Now let's narrow down to the most impactful, feasible ideas.

---

### 4. Convergent Phase - Impact/Effort Matrix (10 minutes)

**Claude**: Let's evaluate these using an Impact vs Effort matrix. I'll plot ideas as:
- Impact: How much will this improve retention? (1-10)
- Effort: How hard to implement? (1-10, where 10 = very hard)

Let me walk through a few examples:

**Idea 30: First 90-day success plan**
- Impact: 9/10 (addresses the critical window)
- Effort: 3/10 (can start manually)
- **Quadrant: HIGH IMPACT, LOW EFFORT → DO FIRST**

**Idea 11: Early warning system**
- Impact: 9/10 (prevents churn proactively)
- Effort: 5/10 (needs data infrastructure)
- **Quadrant: HIGH IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT → PLAN FOR**

**Idea 25: Annual user conference**
- Impact: 6/10 (good for engagement but late in journey)
- Effort: 9/10 (expensive, complex logistics)
- **Quadrant: MEDIUM IMPACT, HIGH EFFORT → MAYBE LATER**

Let me plot all the high-potential ideas:

```
IMPACT ↑
     10│                        │ #11 Early warning (9,5)
       │                        │ #30 First 90-day plan (9,3)
       │                        │ #31 Cohort onboarding (8,4)
       │                        │
     8 │                        │ #3 Progress tracking (8,4)
       │                        │ #10 Success dashboard (8,4)
       │                        │ #17 Template library (8,2)
     6 │                        │
       │ #12 Gamification (4,7) │ #14 In-app help (7,3)
       │ #25 Conference (6,9)   │ #16 Certification (7,5)
     4 │                        │
       │                        │ #32 Surprise/delight (5,2)
     2 │                        │
       │                        │
     0 └────────────────────────┴────────────────────→ EFFORT
       0    2    4    6    8   10
```

**HIGH PRIORITY (DO FIRST)**
These are quick wins with major impact:

**PLAN FOR (Next Quarter)**
High impact but need more planning:

○ **#11: Early warning system** (9 impact, 5 effort)
  - Track usage patterns, engagement drops
  - Automated alerts to success team
  - Requires data infrastructure

○ **#31: Cohort-based onboarding** (8 impact, 4 effort)

  - Celebrate milestones
  - Needs product integration

○ **#10: Success metrics dashboard** (8 impact, 4 effort)
  - Show customers their ROI
  - Benchmark against goals
  - Requires metrics definition

**Claude**: What do you think of this prioritization?

**User**: This makes perfect sense! I can start the 90-day plan and template library this week. The early warning system should definitely be next quarter.

### 6. Session Summary

**Claude**: Excellent session! Here's what we accomplished:

**Generated**: 33 ideas in 12 minutes
**Organized**: 7 thematic categories
**Evaluated**: Plotted on Impact/Effort matrix
**Decided**: 4 immediate actions, 2 next-quarter projects
**Parked**: 4 ideas for future

**Top 3 Priorities**:
1. First 90-day success plan (starting this week)
2. Template library (starting this week)
3. Early warning system (planning for Q4)

**Key Insight**: Retention requires both *automation* (templates, in-app help) and *high-touch* (90-day plans, cohort onboarding). You're tackling both.

**Next Steps**:
- Share prioritized list with team
- Start drafting 90-day plan template
- Schedule planning meeting for Q4 early warning system

Questions or anything you want to revisit?

**User**: This was incredibly helpful! I have a clear roadmap now. Thanks!

**Claude**: Happy to help! Good luck with the implementation. Feel free to come back if you want to brainstorm the implementation details for any of these ideas.
