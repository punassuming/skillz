```bash
python scripts/readability_analyzer.py text_file.txt
python scripts/readability_analyzer.py --text "Your text here"
```
Analyzes readability metrics:
- Flesch Reading Ease score
- Average sentence length
- Complex word percentage
- Problem phrases
- Suggestions for improvement

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Writing Your First Research Paper

1. Review IMRAD structure (`references/paper-structure.md`)
2. Write Introduction using funnel approach (`references/introduction-writing.md`)
3. Document Methods with reproducibility checklist (`references/methods-writing.md`)
4. Report Results objectively with statistics (`references/results-writing.md`)
5. Interpret in Discussion (`references/discussion-writing.md`)
6. Create publication-quality figures (`references/figure-design.md`)
7. Format citations for target journal (`references/citation-management.md`)
8. Write concise Abstract (`references/abstract-writing.md`)
9. Check clarity and conciseness (`references/language-clarity.md`)
10. Review against journal requirements

### Example 2: Responding to Peer Review

1. Read decision letter and all comments carefully
2. Categorize comments (easy/hard, agree/disagree)
3. Address major experiments/revisions first
4. Use response template (`assets/templates/response_letter_template.md`)
5. Follow diplomatic language guidelines (`references/revision-response.md`)
6. Track all changes with line numbers
7. Proofread response letter
8. Submit before deadline

### Example 3: Writing an NIH Grant Proposal

1. Study NIH grant structure (`references/grant-writing.md`)
2. Draft Specific Aims page (1 page, no citations/figures)
3. Write Significance section (why important, impact)
4. Write Innovation section (what's novel)
5. Write Approach section by Aim (design, expected results, problems/alternatives)
6. Include preliminary data supporting feasibility
7. Align with review criteria
8. Get feedback from mock review panel
9. Revise based on feedback
10. Submit complete application

## Best Practices

### Writing Process

1. **Start with structure** - Use IMRAD or appropriate template
2. **Write sections in order** - Methods → Results → Discussion → Introduction → Abstract
3. **One section at a time** - Focus on completing each section
4. **Create figures early** - Visualizations help organize results
5. **Cite as you write** - Use reference manager to stay organized
6. **Get feedback** - Colleagues, advisors, writing groups
7. **Revise multiple times** - First draft is never final
8. **Check against requirements** - Word limits, formatting, style

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Results in Discussion** - Keep observations in Results, interpretations in Discussion
❌ **Interpretation in Results** - "Data suggest..." belongs in Discussion
❌ **New Results in Discussion** - All results must be in Results section first
❌ **Methods in Results** - Detailed methods belong in Methods section
❌ **Missing Statistical Details** - Always include test, df, exact p-value
❌ **Figures Not Referenced** - All figures/tables must be mentioned in text
❌ **Inconsistent Citations** - Use one style throughout
❌ **Vague Language** - "Many samples" → "50 samples"
❌ **Overstating Conclusions** - Match certainty level to evidence
❌ **Ignoring Limitations** - Every study has limitations, acknowledge honestly

## Tips for Success

**Clarity:**
- Use simple words when possible
- Short to medium sentences (15-25 words average)
- One main idea per sentence
- Active voice preferred (field-dependent)

**Precision:**
- Specific numbers over vague terms
- Distinguish statistical significance from importance
- Clear about causation vs. correlation
- Avoid hedging excessively

**Organization:**
- Logical flow from broad to specific
- Clear transitions between sections
- Each paragraph has topic sentence
- Consistent terminology throughout

**Completeness:**
- All essential details for reproducibility
- All figures/tables referenced and described
- All citations complete and consistent
- All review criteria addressed (grants)
