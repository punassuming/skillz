Guide to responding to peer review comments effectively.

** Response Letter Structure

1. /Thank the reviewers/
2. /Summary of major changes/
3. /Point-by-point responses/
4. /List of changes with line numbers/

** Point-by-Point Format

/For each comment:/
1. Quote reviewer comment
2. Your response
3. Changes made in manuscript (with line numbers)

/Template:/
#+begin_src 
Reviewer 1, Comment 3:
"The authors should include a control experiment testing X"

Response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed the suggested control
experiment testing X.

Changes in manuscript: We have added the new control data as Figure S3 and describe it in the
Results section (lines 234-241).
#+end_src

** Response Strategies

*** Strategy 1: Agree and Comply

/When:/ Reviewer is right, change improves paper

/Response:/
"We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have [made the requested change]."

/Example:/
"We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error. We have corrected the statistical test from t-test to ANOVA (line 187) and updated the results accordingly (lines 245-248)."

*** Strategy 2: Agree but Cannot Comply

/When:/ Good suggestion but not feasible (time, resources, scope)

/Response:/
"We agree this would be valuable. However, [explain constraint]. As an alternative, we have [done X]."

/Example:/
"We agree that testing in vivo would strengthen the findings. However, the required animal studies are beyond the scope of this initial report and would require 12+ months. We plan to pursue these studies in future work. As a compromise, we have added additional validation in primary cells (new Figure 4)."

*** Strategy 3: Respectfully Disagree

/When:/ Reviewer misunderstood or is incorrect

/Response:/
"We respectfully disagree with this comment. [Explain why with evidence]."

/Be diplomatic but firm/

/Example:/
"We respectfully disagree with this interpretation. Our data show that X decreases rather than increases (Figure 2B, p < 0.001). The apparent increase mentioned by the reviewer may reflect the Y axis scale. We have clarified this in the figure caption (lines 512-515)."

*** Strategy 4: Clarification Needed

/When:/ Unclear what reviewer wants

/Response:/
"We have interpreted this comment as requesting [X]. We have [made change]. If the reviewer intended something different, we would be happy to address it."

/Example:/
"We understand this comment to request additional statistical analysis comparing groups A and B. We have added this analysis (Table S2) and describe it in Results (lines 234-237). Please let us know if additional analysis is needed."

** Diplomatic Language

*** Positive Phrases

"We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment..."
"We appreciate the opportunity to clarify..."
"This is an excellent suggestion..."
"The reviewer raises an important point..."
"We agree this strengthens the manuscript..."

*** When Disagreeing

"We respectfully disagree because..."
"We believe our original interpretation is supported by..."
"While we understand the reviewer's concern, we note that..."
"We have considered this alternative explanation, but..."

*** Avoid

❌ "The reviewer is wrong"
❌ "This is a ridiculous comment"
❌ "The reviewer obviously didn't read carefully"
❌ Defensive or dismissive tone
❌ Sarcasm

** Tracking Changes in Manuscript

*** Highlight All Changes

/Options:/
- Track changes (Word)
- Colored text
- Highlighted text
- Strikethrough for deletions

/Submit:/
- Clean version (final)
- Marked-up version (with changes highlighted)

*** Reference Line Numbers

/Always include line numbers in response:/
"We have addressed this by adding text to lines 234-237"

/Specific changes:/
"In the revised manuscript (lines 345-348), we have changed the statistical test from..."

** Major vs. Minor Revisions

*** Major Revisions

/Require:/
- Substantial new experiments
- Major reanalysis
- Significant manuscript revision
- May require new peer review round

/Timeline:/ Typically 2-6 months allowed

*** Minor Revisions

/Require:/
- Clarifications
- Additional analysis of existing data
- Text revisions
- Minor experiments

/Timeline:/ Typically 1-2 months allowed

** Common Scenarios

*** Multiple Reviewers Disagree

/Approach:/
Address all comments, explain when reviewer views conflict

/Example:/
"Reviewer 1 suggested X, while Reviewer 2 suggested Y. We have [chosen approach] because [rationale]. We believe this addresses both reviewers' underlying concerns."

*** Reviewer Asks for Impossible Experiment

/Response:/
Explain why not feasible, offer alternative

"While we agree this experiment would be interesting, it requires [resource/time not available]. As an alternative, we have [feasible approach] which addresses the same question."

*** Reviewer Questions Fundamental Approach

/Response:/
Defend your approach with evidence and citations

"We chose this approach because [reasons with citations]. While [alternative] could also work, [explain advantages of your approach]."

*** Reviewer Misunderstood

/Response:/
Clarify in response letter AND improve manuscript clarity

"We apologize for the confusion. We have clarified this point in the manuscript (lines 123-126) to make it clear that..."
