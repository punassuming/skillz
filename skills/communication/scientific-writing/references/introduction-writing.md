* Introduction Writing

Comprehensive guide to writing effective research paper introductions.

** Introduction Funnel Structure

The introduction should guide readers from general context to specific objectives using a funnel approach.

*** 1. Broad Context (Opening 1-2 paragraphs)

/Purpose:/ Establish why the general topic matters

/What to include:/
- Why this topic is important to science/society
- General background accessible to broader audience
- Current state of knowledge (high-level)

/Examples:/

/Biology:/
"Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, with over 10 million deaths annually [1]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression is essential for developing effective therapies. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays a central role in regulating cell growth, survival, and metabolism [2,3]."

/Computer Science:/
"Machine learning models increasingly power critical decision-making systems in healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. However, these models can perpetuate or amplify existing biases in training data, leading to unfair outcomes [1-3]. Developing methods to detect and mitigate algorithmic bias is therefore essential for responsible AI deployment."

/Engineering:/
"Renewable energy storage is critical for grid stabilization as solar and wind power adoption increases. Lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the market but face limitations in cost, energy density, and environmental impact [1,2]. Alternative battery chemistries could address these challenges and enable broader renewable energy adoption."

*** 2. Narrow Focus (Middle 1-2 paragraphs)

/Purpose:/ Zoom into specific problem area and review relevant work

/What to include:/
- More specific background on your problem area
- Synthesis of relevant previous work
- What is currently known
- Key findings from literature

/Synthesis strategies:/

/Thematic organization/ (preferred):
"Several studies have examined X in context of Y. Smith et al. showed that A affects B [5], while Jones and colleagues demonstrated C's role in D [6]. These findings collectively suggest that E is regulated by F"

/Not chronological listing:/
❌ "In 2015, Smith studied X. In 2017, Jones examined Y. In 2020, Brown investigated Z..."
✅ "X has been shown to affect Y through multiple mechanisms, including A [5], B [6], and C [7]"

/Compare and contrast:/
"Some studies report that X increases Y [5,6], while others find no effect [7,8]. These discrepancies may reflect differences in experimental conditions..."

/Examples by field:/

/Wet lab biology:/
"Previous studies have identified multiple regulators of autophagy, including mTOR [4], AMPK [5], and ULK1 [6]. In particular, nutrient deprivation activates AMPK, which phosphorylates ULK1 to initiate autophagosome formation [7]. However, the role of lipid metabolism in this process remains unclear"

/Computational:/
"Several approaches have been proposed to detect bias in machine learning models. Pre-processing methods modify training data to remove bias [8,9], in-processing methods incorporate fairness constraints during training [10,11], and post-processing methods adjust model predictions [12]. Each approach has trade-offs between fairness metrics and model accuracy"

/Engineering:/
"Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a promising alternative to lithium-ion due to sodium's abundance and low cost [3]. Recent advances in cathode materials, including layered oxides [4,5] and polyanionic compounds [6,7], have improved energy density and cycle life. However, anode materials remain a challenge due to sodium's larger ionic radius"

*** 3. Knowledge Gap (Critical 1 paragraph)

/Purpose:/ Identify what's unknown or needs improvement

/Types of gaps:/

/Knowledge gap:/
"However, whether X affects Y in Z context remains unknown"
"The molecular mechanisms underlying A's effect on B are not understood"

/Methodological gap:/
"Previous studies used A method, which cannot B. A new approach is needed to C"
"Existing techniques for measuring X lack the resolution to detect Y"

/Application gap:/
"While X has been studied in A, its role in B has not been examined"
"No one has applied technique A to problem B"

/Resolution gap:/
"Studies report contradictory results regarding X's effect on Y [5,6 vs 7,8]. These discrepancies need resolution"

/Integration gap:/
"Although A and B are both known to affect C, how they interact is unclear"

/Examples:/

/Knowledge gap:/
"Despite extensive characterization of autophagy regulation, the role of lipid droplets in autophagosome formation remains poorly understood"

/Methodological gap:/
"Existing bias detection methods require access to sensitive demographic data, which may not be available or ethical to collect. Methods that can detect bias without explicit demographic labels are needed"

/Application gap:/
"While Prussian blue analogs have shown promise as cathode materials, their potential as sodium-ion battery anodes has not been explored"

/Resolution gap:/
"Conflicting reports exist regarding the effect of temperature on catalyst performance [8,9 vs 10,11], likely due to differences in reaction conditions"

/Transition phrases to gap:/
- "However, ..."
- "Despite these advances, ..."
- "Nevertheless, ..."
- "Yet ..."
- "What remains unclear is ..."
- "An important question is ..."

*** 4. Objective Statement (Last paragraph)

/Purpose:/ State clearly what this study does

/Characteristics:/
- Clear and specific
- Testable/addressable
- Focused (not too broad)
- Usually in last paragraph of introduction
- Can include hypothesis if appropriate

/Structure options:/

/Option 1: Direct objective/
"Here, we investigate X's role in Y using Z approach"
"This study examines whether A affects B in C system"
"We sought to determine how D regulates E"

/Option 2: With hypothesis/
"We hypothesized that X regulates Y through Z mechanism. To test this, we..."

/Option 3: With aims/objectives/
"To address this gap, we had three objectives: (1) determine X, (2) examine Y, and (3) test Z"

/Option 4: Study description/
"In this study, we used A method to examine B in C system. We found that..."
(This version previews results - common in some fields)

/Examples:/

/Biology (with hypothesis):/
"We hypothesized that lipid droplets serve as membrane source for autophagosome formation during nutrient starvation. To test this, we used live-cell imaging, lipidomics, and genetic manipulation to examine the interaction between lipid droplets and autophagosomes in mammalian cells"

/Computer Science (direct):/
"Here, we develop a method for detecting algorithmic bias using only model predictions and outcomes, without requiring demographic information. Our approach leverages statistical fairness metrics and anomaly detection to identify systematic disparities in model performance across subgroups"

/Engineering (with aims):/
"To address these limitations, we investigated Prussian blue analogs as sodium-ion battery anodes. Our objectives were to: (1) synthesize and characterize Prussian blue analog nanoparticles, (2) evaluate electrochemical performance, and (3) elucidate sodium storage mechanisms"

/Physics (theoretical):/
"Here, we develop a theoretical framework to describe X in Y regime. We derive analytical expressions for Z and validate predictions using numerical simulations"

*** 5. Approach Overview (Optional, 1-2 sentences)

/Purpose:/ Give reader preview of methods (very brief)

/When to include:/
- Novel methodology that readers may not be familiar with
- When approach is particularly important to understanding study
- Short papers where methods section is minimal

/When to skip:/
- Standard methodology that's well known
- When methods section will provide detail anyway
- When word limits are tight

/Example:/
"We combined single-cell RNA sequencing with CRISPR screening to identify genes required for X"

** Literature Review in Introduction

*** Purpose

- Establish what's known
- Build logical argument for your work
- Identify gap
- Show you understand the field

*** NOT an exhaustive review

/Introduction lit review:/
- Focused on your specific question
- Synthesizes key findings
- Typically 10-30 key references
- Sets up your study

/Review paper:/
- Comprehensive coverage
- May cite 100+ papers
- Systematic organization
- Critical evaluation

*** Synthesis vs. Listing

/Good synthesis (thematic):/
"Autophagy can be induced by multiple stress signals, including nutrient deprivation [5,6], hypoxia [7], and ER stress [8,9]. These diverse stimuli converge on common regulatory nodes, particularly the ULK1 complex [10]. However, signal-specific variations in autophagy outcomes suggest additional regulatory layers [11,12]"

/Poor listing (chronological):/
"In 2015, Smith showed that X [5]. In 2016, Jones found Y [6]. In 2018, Brown demonstrated Z [7]..."

*** How much literature to include

/Too little:/
- Missing key papers in field
- Not establishing context
- Gap seems artificial

/Too much:/
- Reading like a review paper
- Losing focus on your specific question
- Overwhelming reader

/Right amount:/
- Key papers establishing context
- Recent relevant work
- Directly related to your gap
- Sets up your study

*** Citation patterns

/Multiple papers for one point:/
"X has been shown to regulate Y [5-8]" (if all agree)
"X affects Y [5,6], though the magnitude varies [7,8]" (if nuanced)

/Contrasting findings:/
"Some studies report X [5,6], while others find Y [7,8]"

/Building evidence:/
"Initial studies suggested X [5], which was confirmed by Y [6] and extended by Z [7]"

** Gap Identification Strategies

*** Making the gap compelling

/Not compelling:/
"No one has studied X in Y" (so what? maybe not important)

/Compelling:/
"Understanding X in Y is critical for Z, yet this has not been examined" (explains why gap matters)

/Elements of compelling gap:/
1. Why it's important
2. Why it hasn't been addressed
3. How your study will address it

*** Avoiding overstated gaps

/Overstated:/
"Nothing is known about X" (rarely true)
"This is the first study to examine X" (often wrong, hard to verify)

/Better:/
"Limited information exists regarding X"
"To our knowledge, no studies have examined X in Y context"

*** Gap types by field

/Basic science:/
- Mechanistic understanding
- Novel phenomenon
- Conflicting results to resolve

/Applied science:/
- Performance improvement needed
- New application
- Practical limitation to overcome

/Methods:/
- Existing methods can't measure/detect X
- New technology enables new questions
- Better/faster/cheaper approach needed

** Tense Usage in Introduction

*** Present tense

/For established facts:/

** Common Introduction Problems

*** Problem: Missing gap

/Symptom:/ Introduction describes lots of background but doesn't identify what's unknown

/Fix:/ Explicitly state what's missing or unclear, usually with "However," "Despite," or "What remains unknown"

*** Problem: Unclear objective

/Symptom:/ Reader finishes introduction not knowing what study will do

/Fix:/ Last paragraph should clearly state "Here we investigate..." or similar

*** Problem: Too much detail

/Symptom:/ Introduction reads like a review paper

/Fix:/ Focus literature review on what directly relates to your gap and objective

*** Problem: Laundry listing papers

/Symptom:/ Series of sentences each citing a different paper without synthesis

/Fix:/ Group related findings thematically, comparing and contrasting

*** Problem: Gap doesn't connect to objective

/Symptom:/ "X is unknown" but then "We studied Y" (different thing)

/Fix:/ Make sure your objective directly addresses the gap you identified

*** Problem: Background assumes too much knowledge

/Symptom:/ Jumping into specialized details without context

/Fix:/ Start broader, provide enough context for non-specialist in your field

*** Problem: Background too broad

/Symptom:/ Introduction could be for any paper in your field

/Fix:/ Narrow focus earlier, get to your specific topic sooner
