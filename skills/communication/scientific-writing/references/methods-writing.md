Channels were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/mL) for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were loaded at 10⁶ cells/mL and allowed to adhere for 2 hours. Chemoattractant gradient was established by replacing medium in outlet reservoir every 30 minutes. Cell positions were tracked every 5 minutes for 4 hours using time-lapse microscopy"

/Better:/
"Cells were cultured in complete DMEM at 37°C in 5% CO₂"

/Unclear:/
"The experiment was done in triplicate"
(Technical or biological? Within one experiment or independent experiments?)

/Clear:/
