* Language Clarity in Scientific Writing

Guide to clear, concise, and precise scientific writing.

** Core Principles

1. /Clarity over complexity/ - Simple words when possible
2. /Precision/ - Exact meaning, no ambiguity
3. /Conciseness/ - Eliminate unnecessary words
4. /Objectivity/ - Avoid emotional language
5. /Active voice/ - Preferred when possible (field-dependent)

** Passive vs. Active Voice

*** Active Voice (Preferred)

/Benefits:/
- More direct and clear
- Shorter sentences
- Identifies who did what
- More engaging to read

/Examples:/
- "We measured cell viability" (active)
- "The data show that..." (active)
- "We found that X correlates with Y" (active)

*** Passive Voice (Acceptable)

/When to use:/
- Methods section (field tradition in biology/chemistry)
- When actor unknown or irrelevant
- To emphasize action over actor

/Examples:/
- "Cells were cultured at 37°C" (passive - actor irrelevant)
- "Samples were analyzed by HPLC" (passive - emphasis on samples)

*** Field Norms

/Biology/Medicine:/ More passive acceptable, especially in methods
/Engineering/CS:/ Active voice strongly preferred
/Physics:/ Either acceptable
/Social Sciences:/ Increasingly favoring active

/Be consistent within your paper/

** Conciseness Strategies

*** Remove Redundant Phrases

/Wordy → Concise:/
- "blue in color" → "blue"
- "oval in shape" → "oval"
- "a total of 50 samples" → "50 samples"
- "at a temperature of 37°C" → "at 37°C"
- "in order to" → "to"
- "due to the fact that" → "because"
- "it is important to note that" → delete

*** Avoid Nominalizations

/Nominalization (wordy) → Verb (concise):/
- "perform an analysis of" → "analyze"
- "make a measurement of" → "measure"
- "conduct an investigation into" → "investigate"
- "provide a description of" → "describe"

*** Eliminate Filler Words

/Remove without losing meaning:/
- "It is important to note that..."
- "It should be emphasized that..."
- "It has been shown that..."
- "It is well known that..."

/Example:/
/Before:/ "It is important to note that treatment significantly increased cell viability"
/After:/ "Treatment significantly increased cell viability"

*** Combine Sentences

/Before:/ "X is a protein. This protein regulates Y. Y is important for Z"
/After:/ "X, a protein regulating Y, is important for Z"

** Precision in Language

*** Avoid Vague Terms

/Vague → Precise:/
- "relatively high" → "2.5-fold higher"
- "quite significant" → "significant (p < 0.001)"
- "very low concentration" → "10 nM"
- "many samples" → "50 samples"
- "recently" → "in 2022"

*** Distinguish Related Terms

/"Significant" (statistical) vs. "Important" (meaningful):/
- ✅ "statistically significant (p < 0.05)"
- ✅ "biologically important"
- ❌ "significant" (ambiguous - statistical or meaningful?)

/"Correlation" vs. "Causation":/
- ✅ "X correlates with Y"
- ✅ "X causes Y"
- ❌ "X affects Y" (when only correlation shown)

/"Accuracy" vs. "Precision":/
- Accuracy: closeness to true value
- Precision: reproducibility of measurements

*** Be Clear About Certainty Level

/Levels of certainty:/
- "demonstrates that..." (strong)
- "shows that..." (strong)
- "suggests that..." (moderate)
- "may indicate that..." (weak)
- "possibly..." (very weak)

/Match certainty to evidence/

** Sentence Structure

*** Keep Sentences Short-Medium

/Aim for:/ 15-25 words average
/Too long (40+ words):/ Hard to follow, reader gets lost
/Too short (< 10 words):/ Choppy, lack sophistication

/Long sentence fixed:/
/Before:/ "Treatment with Compound X at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μM for periods of 6, 12, and 24 hours resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in cell viability in both HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, as measured by MTT assay performed in triplicate across three independent experiments" (58 words!)

/After:/ "Treatment with Compound X (1-100 μM) increased cell viability dose- and time-dependently in HeLa and MCF-7 cells. Viability was measured by MTT assay in triplicate across three experiments" (31 words)

*** Put Main Idea First

/Unclear:/ "In cells treated with X, after 24 hours of incubation at 37°C, expression increased"
/Clear:/ "Expression increased in cells treated with X for 24 hours at 37°C"

*** Use Parallel Structure

/Not parallel:/ "The method is fast, accurate, and has reliability"
/Parallel:/ "The method is fast, accurate, and reliable"

/Not parallel:/ "We measured X, analyzed Y, and the determination of Z"
/Parallel:/ "We measured X, analyzed Y, and determined Z"

*** One Idea Per Sentence

/Too much:/ "Expression increased and we think this is because of pathway activation which was supported by the phosphorylation data and this has implications for therapy"

/Better:/
"Expression increased, possibly due to pathway activation. This is supported by increased phosphorylation. These findings have therapeutic implications"

** Paragraph Structure

*** Topic Sentence First

/Each paragraph should:/
1. Start with topic sentence (main idea)
2. Supporting sentences develop idea
3. Conclude or transition to next paragraph

*** Logical Flow

/Use transitions:/
- However
- Moreover
- In contrast
- Similarly
- Therefore
- Consequently

/Connect paragraphs:/
- Each paragraph builds on previous
- Clear logical progression
- Transitional phrases link ideas

** Common Writing Problems

*** Problem: Jargon Overuse

/Balance:/ Assume audience has field background, but define specialized terms

/Define at first use:/ "autophagy (cellular self-digestion)"

/Don't explain fundamentals:/ No need to define "protein" or "DNA" for scientific audience

*** Problem: Ambiguous Pronoun References

/Unclear:/ "X binds to Y and promotes its activity" (whose activity? X's or Y's?)

/Clear:/ "X binds to Y and promotes Y's activity"

*** Problem: Dangling Modifiers

/Wrong:/ "Using flow cytometry, the cells showed increased expression"
(Cells aren't using flow cytometry!)

/Right:/ "Using flow cytometry, we observed increased expression in cells"
/Or:/ "Flow cytometry revealed increased expression in cells"

*** Problem: Subject-Verb Disagreement

/Wrong:/ "The data shows that..."
(Data is plural!)

/Right:/ "The data show that..."
/Or:/ "The dataset shows that..."

*** Problem: Inconsistent Terminology

/Wrong:/ "We measured gene expression... mRNA levels increased... transcript abundance was higher"
(Use one term consistently)

/Right:/ "We measured gene expression... Expression increased... Expression was higher"

** Readability Metrics

*** Flesch Reading Ease

/Score:/ 0-100 (higher = easier)
/Target for scientific papers:/ 40-60 (difficult but acceptable)
/Factors:/ Sentence length, syllables per word

*** Average Sentence Length

/Aim for:/ 15-25 words
/Too long:/ >30 words average
/Too short:/ <12 words average

*** Complex Words

/Definition:/ Words with 3+ syllables
/Target:/ <20% complex words

/Balance:/ Scientific writing will have technical terms, but don't make it harder than necessary

** Style Guide Preferences

/Check journal guidelines for:/
- Active vs. passive voice preference
- First person ("we") vs. third person ("the authors")
- Tense usage in different sections
- Abbreviation policies
- Number formatting (spell out or use numerals)
- Hyphenation
- Serial comma

** Numbers and Units

*** When to Spell Out

/Spell out:/
- Numbers beginning sentences: "Fifteen samples were..."
- Numbers under 10 (some styles): "five experiments"

/Use numerals:/
- With units: "5 mL", "10 μM", "37°C"
- Percentages: "15%"
- Statistics: "n = 5", "p = 0.03"
- Numbers 10+ (some styles)

*** Units

/Always:/
- Space between number and unit: "5 mL" not "5mL"
- Exception: Degrees and percent: "37°C", "15%"

** Abbreviations

/First use:/ Spell out with abbreviation in parentheses
"polymerase chain reaction (PCR)"

/Subsequent uses:/ Abbreviation only
"PCR was performed..."

/Don't overuse:/ If term appears < 3 times, consider not abbreviating

/Standard abbreviations:/ No need to define (DNA, RNA, ATP, etc.)
