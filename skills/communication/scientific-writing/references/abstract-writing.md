* Abstract Writing

Comprehensive guide to writing effective research paper abstracts.

** Core Purpose

The abstract is a /standalone summary/ of your entire paper

- Often the only part people read
- Determines whether they read full paper
- Indexed in databases (searchable)
- Must be self-contained and complete
- No citations (usually)

** Abstract Types

*** Structured Abstract

/Has labeled sections (common in medical journals):/
- Background/Introduction
- Objectives/Aims
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusions

/Example (structured):/
#+begin_src 
Background: Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis, but the role of lipid droplets in
autophagosome formation remains unclear.

Objectives: To determine whether lipid droplets serve as membrane source for autophagosomes
during nutrient starvation.

Methods: We used live-cell imaging, lipidomics, and genetic manipulation to examine the
interaction between lipid droplets and autophagosomes in HeLa cells.

Results: Upon starvation, lipid droplets relocated to autophagosome formation sites (78%
colocalization). Lipidomic analysis revealed lipid transfer from droplets to autophagosomes.
Blocking lipid droplet function reduced autophagosome formation by 65% (p < 0.001).

Conclusions: Lipid droplets serve as membrane source for autophagosome formation, revealing
a critical link between lipid metabolism and autophagy.

*** Unstructured Abstract

/No section labels, flowing paragraph(s):/
- More common in basic science journals
- Same content as structured, just not labeled
- Can be single paragraph or multiple

/Example (unstructured):/
#+begin_src 
Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis, but the role of lipid droplets in autophagosome
formation remains unclear. Here, we show that lipid droplets serve as membrane source for
autophagosomes during nutrient starvation. Using live-cell imaging, we found that lipid
droplets relocate to autophagosome formation sites upon starvation (78% colocalization).
Lipidomic analysis revealed lipid transfer from droplets to autophagosomes, and blocking
lipid droplet function reduced autophagosome formation by 65% (p < 0.001). These findings
reveal a critical link between lipid metabolism and autophagy.

*** Graphical Abstract

/Visual summary (increasingly common):/
- Single figure summarizing key finding
- Required by some journals (Cell, etc.)
- Complements text abstract
- See references/figure-design.md for creating

** Word Limit Strategies

*** Common Limits

- 150 words: Very concise (letters, short communications)
- 200-250 words: Standard
- 300 words: Generous
- 350+ words: Review papers, comprehensive studies

*** Fitting Content in Tight Limits

/Prioritize:/
1. Key results with data
2. Main objective
3. Conclusions/implications
4. Brief context
5. Methods (just enough to understand)

/Remove:/
- Unnecessary modifiers ("very," "highly," "extremely")
- Redundant phrases
- Detailed background
- Minor findings
- Methodological details

/Example revision:/

/Original (260 words):/
"Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular degradation process that is very important for maintaining cellular homeostasis by removing damaged organelles and protein aggregates. Previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy plays a critical role in many diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite extensive research into the regulation of autophagy, the precise role of lipid droplets in autophagosome formation has remained poorly understood. Here, we investigated..."

/Revised (180 words):/
"Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis, but the role of lipid droplets in autophagosome formation remains unclear. Here, we investigated..."

(Removed: "highly conserved," "very important," "by removing damaged organelles," "Previous studies have demonstrated," "precise," etc.)

*** Techniques for Conciseness

/Remove filler phrases:/
- "It is important to note that..." → delete
- "In order to" → "To"
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "A number of" → "Several" or "Many"

/Use shorter words when possible:/
- "Utilize" → "Use"
- "Demonstrate" → "Show"
- "Facilitate" → "Enable"
- "Approximately" → "About" or "~"

/Combine sentences:/
Original: "Treatment increased viability. This effect was dose-dependent"
Revised: "Treatment increased viability dose-dependently"

/Remove obvious statements:/
"These findings are important..." (if they're in your paper, they're important)
"Further research is needed..." (this is always true)

** Self-Contained Requirement

/Abstract must be understandable WITHOUT reading the paper/

*** Define Specialized Terms

/Wrong (assumes knowledge):/
"We examined the role of mTOR in ULK1-mediated autophagosome biogenesis"

/Right (defines terms):/
"We examined how mTOR (a nutrient sensor) regulates autophagosome formation (the initiation of autophagy)"

/Or:/
"We examined the role of mTOR, a master regulator of cell growth, in autophagy initiation"

*** Include Context

/Wrong (no context):/
"We tested Compound X in HeLa cells and found 60% reduction"

/Right (provides context):/
"Compound X, a novel kinase inhibitor, reduced tumor cell viability by 60%"

*** Avoid Abbreviations (or Define All)

/Minimize abbreviations:/
- Save precious word count
- Each abbreviation requires definition
- Reader may not remember abbreviation

/If using abbreviations:/
"We measured glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)... HbA1c decreased by 1.2%"

/Often better to just spell out:/
"Glycated hemoglobin decreased by 1.2%"

*** No Citations (Usually)

/Most journals don't allow citations in abstract/

/Don't write:/
"Previous studies [5-7] showed... We found that..."

/Write:/
"Previous studies showed... We found that..."

/Or:/
"Smith et al. showed... We found that..."
(Name only, no citation number)

/Exception:/ Some review paper abstracts allow citations

** Keywords

*** Purpose

- Database indexing
- Search engine optimization
- Help readers find your paper

*** Selection Strategy

/3-6 keywords typical/

/Choose:/
- Terms NOT in your title
- Searchable/standard terminology
- Field-specific terms researchers would search
- MeSH terms (for biomedical research)

/Examples:/

/Title:/ "Lipid Droplets Serve as Membrane Source for Autophagosome Formation"

/Keywords:/ autophagy, lipid metabolism, organelle contact sites, starvation response, cellular homeostasis

(Don't repeat "lipid droplets" or "autophagosome" - already in title)

/Title:/ "A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Bias Detection in Machine Learning Models"

/Keywords:/ algorithmic fairness, model auditing, fairness metrics, bias mitigation, responsible AI

*** Avoid

- Very general terms ("biology," "chemistry")
- Terms too specific to your exact study
- Non-standard abbreviations
- Terms already in title (usually)

** Conference Abstracts vs. Journal Abstracts

*** Conference Abstracts

/Key differences:/
- May be only deliverable (no full paper)
- More selective in what to emphasize
- Can be more preliminary ("we will present...")
- May allow future tense
- Often shorter (150-250 words)

/Example future tense (acceptable in conference abstract):/
"We will present a novel method for... Results will demonstrate..."

*** Journal Abstracts

/Characteristics:/
- Accompanies full paper
- Comprehensive summary
- Past tense for what was done
- Present tense for conclusions
- Usually 200-300 words

** Common Abstract Problems

*** Problem: Too Much Background

/Wrong:/
"Autophagy is a cellular degradation process discovered in the 1960s by Christian de Duve. It involves the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes that engulf cellular contents and fuse with lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy plays roles in development, immunity, aging, and disease. It is regulated by multiple signaling pathways including mTOR, AMPK, and p53..."
(Spends half the abstract on background!)

/Right:/
"Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis, but the role of lipid droplets in autophagosome formation remains unclear"
(One sentence of background, move on)

*** Problem: Vague Results

/Wrong:/
"Treatment significantly improved outcomes and reduced side effects. The new method showed better performance than existing approaches"
(No actual data!)

/Right:/
"Treatment improved survival by 6 months (median: 24 vs 18 months, p = 0.003) and reduced grade 3+ toxicity (15% vs 35%, p < 0.001)"

*** Problem: Methods Too Detailed

/Wrong:/
"We cultured HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) in DMEM (Gibco #11965) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% pen-strep at 37°C in 5% CO₂. Cells were seeded at 5×10⁴ cells/well in 24-well plates 24 hours before treatment with 1 μM doxorubicin..."

/Right:/
"Using live-cell imaging and lipidomics in cultured mammalian cells..."

*** Problem: Missing Data

/Wrong:/
"Expression significantly increased with treatment"

/Right:/
"Expression increased 3-fold with treatment (p < 0.001)"

*** Problem: Inconsistent with Paper

/Abstract says X, but paper shows Y/
Abstract is binding - must accurately reflect paper content

*** Problem: References to Figures

/Wrong:/
"Cell viability increased (Figure 2)"

/Right:/
"Cell viability increased by 35%"

(Figures aren't available when reading just abstract)

** Examples by Field

*** Molecular Biology

"Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis, but the role of lipid droplets in autophagosome formation remains unclear. Here, we show that lipid droplets serve as membrane source for autophagosomes during nutrient starvation. Using live-cell imaging, we found that lipid droplets relocate to autophagosome formation sites upon starvation, with 78% colocalization. Lipidomic analysis revealed preferential transfer of phosphatidylethanolamine from lipid droplets to forming autophagosomes. Genetic ablation of lipid droplet function reduced autophagosome formation by 65% (p < 0.001) and impaired autophagic flux. These findings reveal a critical link between lipid metabolism and autophagy, establishing lipid droplets as key organelles in the cellular starvation response"

*** Clinical Research

"Background: Diabetes management in elderly patients remains challenging due to polypharmacy and hypoglycemia risk.

Objective: To evaluate safety and efficacy of simplified insulin regimen in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 240 patients aged ≥70 years with HbA1c >8%. Patients received either simplified once-daily insulin (n=120) or standard multiple-injection regimen (n=120) for 12 months.

Results: Simplified regimen achieved similar HbA1c reduction (1.2% vs 1.3%, p=0.61) with significantly fewer hypoglycemic events (0.8 vs 2.3 events/patient-year, p<0.001) and better treatment adherence (89% vs 67%, p<0.001).

Conclusions: Simplified insulin regimen provides comparable glycemic control with improved safety in elderly patients, supporting its use in this population"

*** Engineering

"Lithium-ion batteries face limitations in cost and sustainability, driving interest in alternative chemistries. Here, we develop sodium-ion battery anodes using Prussian blue analogs. We synthesized manganese-based Prussian blue analog nanoparticles (50 nm diameter) and evaluated electrochemical performance. The material delivered 125 mAh/g capacity with 95% retention after 500 cycles at 1C rate. Rate capability reached 85 mAh/g at 10C. Operando X-ray diffraction revealed reversible sodium insertion with minimal structural changes, explaining excellent cyclability. These results establish Prussian blue analogs as promising low-cost, sustainable sodium-ion battery anodes, with performance approaching lithium-ion technology"

*** Computer Science

"Machine learning models can perpetuate biases in training data, but detecting bias typically requires sensitive demographic information. We develop a method for detecting algorithmic bias using only model predictions and outcomes, without demographic labels. Our approach combines statistical fairness metrics with anomaly detection to identify systematic disparities. Evaluation on three datasets (credit, hiring, healthcare) showed 91-96% accuracy in detecting biased models, matching performance of methods requiring demographic data. The approach identified bias in 73% of models tested, including subtle biases missed by standard metrics. This work enables bias detection in settings where demographic data is unavailable or unethical to collect"
