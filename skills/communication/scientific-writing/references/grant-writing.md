- /Critical:/ Reviewers want to see you've thought this through

/Timeline:/
- Years 1-2: Aim 1
- Years 2-3: Aim 2
- Years 4-5: Aim 3

/Example Approach Section:/
#+begin_src 
Aim 1: Determine molecular mechanism of X resistance

Rationale: Our preliminary data show that 70% of X-resistant cells have elevated Y levels (Fig. 1).
This suggests Y may mediate resistance. Understanding this mechanism is critical because...

Experimental Design:
1.1. Identify signaling pathways activated by Y (RNA-seq, proteomics)
   Methods: We will perform RNA-seq on resistant vs sensitive cells (n=4 per group...
   Expected Results: We expect to identify...

1.2. Test whether Y is required for resistance (genetic manipulation)
   Methods: We will use CRISPR to delete Y in resistant cells...
   Expected Results: We predict that...

1.3. Determine how Y confers resistance (mechanism studies)
   ...

Potential Problems and Alternatives:
Problem: If Y deletion doesn't reverse resistance...
Alternative: We will test whether Y works redundantly with Z...

*** Preliminary Data

/Purpose:/
- Demonstrate feasibility
- Show your capability
- Support hypothesis
- Prove concept works

/Balance:/
- Enough to show feasibility
- Not so much that project seems finished

/What to include:/

- Method validation
- Pilot studies
- Published and unpublished data

*** Other NIH Grant Sections

/Bibliography:/ Cited references (no page limit)

/Biographical Sketch:/ NIH format, 5 pages
- Education and positions
- Personal statement (why you're suited for this)
- Contributions to science (up to 5, with key papers)
- Research support

/Budget and Justification:/
- Personnel with effort justification
- Equipment
- Supplies
- Travel

** Common Grant Writing Problems

*** Problem: Too Ambitious

/Symptom:/ Trying to do too much in timeframe

/Fix:/ Focus on achievable aims; one major finding per aim is sufficient

*** Problem: Insufficient Preliminary Data

/Symptom:/ No evidence that approach will work

/Fix:/ Generate pilot data; show feasibility; demonstrate your capability

*** Problem: Weak Connection Between Aims

/Symptom:/ Aims seem like separate projects

/Fix:/ Ensure aims address related questions that build toward common goal

*** Problem: Missing Pitfalls/Alternatives

/Symptom:/ Everything will work perfectly (unrealistic!)

/Fix:/ Identify potential problems and describe alternative approaches

*** Problem: Poor Writing Clarity

/Symptom:/ Reviewers can't understand proposal

/Fix:/ Clear writing, defined terms, logical flow, figures to illustrate

*** Problem: Not Addressing Review Criteria

/Symptom:/ Leaving reviewers to figure out how proposal meets criteria

/Fix:/ Explicitly address all review criteria with matching subheadings
