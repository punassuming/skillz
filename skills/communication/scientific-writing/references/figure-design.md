* Figure Design

Comprehensive guide to creating publication-quality figures for research papers.

** Figure Types by Data Type

*** Line Plots
/Use for:/ Trends over continuous variable (time, dose, etc.)
/Best for:/ Time series, dose-response curves, continuous relationships

/Design tips:/
- Clear axis labels with units
- Distinct line styles for multiple series
- Legend or direct labeling
- Error bars/shading for uncertainty
- Grid lines if helpful for reading values

*** Bar Plots
/Use for:/ Comparing discrete categories
/Best for:/ Group comparisons, categorical data

/Design tips:/
- Bars should start at zero (or use break symbol if not)
- Error bars on top
- Group related bars
- Consider horizontal bars for long category names
- Consistent bar width

*** Scatter Plots
/Use for:/ Showing individual data points, correlations
/Best for:/ Distributions, correlations, outlier detection

/Design tips:/
- Semi-transparent points if many overlapping
- Include regression line if showing correlation
- Report R² and p-value
- Consider logarithmic axes for wide ranges

*** Box Plots / Violin Plots
/Use for:/ Showing distributions with quartiles
/Best for:/ Comparing distributions across groups

/Design tips:/
- Show individual points if n is small
- Explain box components in caption
- Consider violin plots for distribution shape
- Consistent width across boxes

*** Heatmaps
/Use for:/ Matrices, multi-dimensional data
/Best for:/ Gene expression, correlation matrices, spatial data

/Design tips:/
- Appropriate color scale (sequential, diverging, qualitative)
- Color bar with limits and units
- Clustering if appropriate
- Row/column labels readable

*** Schematics / Diagrams
/Use for:/ Concepts, workflows, experimental design
/Best for:/ Illustrating methods, models, hypotheses

/Design tips:/
- Simple, uncluttered
- Consistent visual language
- Clear arrows showing flow/relationships
- Labeled components

*** Microscopy Images
/Use for:/ Showing spatial organization, morphology
/Best for:/ Cells, tissues, materials

/Design tips:/
- Scale bar with size
- Channel labels (if multi-color)
- Consistent contrast/brightness across compared images
- Insets for details if needed

** Publication Quality Requirements

*** Resolution
- /Minimum 300 DPI/ for print publication
- 600 DPI preferred for line art
- 600-1200 DPI for combination art (photos + line art)
- Web figures can be 72-150 DPI

/Check your resolution:/
#+begin_src python
# If using matplotlib
fig.savefig('figure.png', dpi=300)
fig.savefig('figure.pdf')  # Vector, resolution-independent
#+end_src

*** File Formats

/Vector formats (preferred when possible):/
- PDF: Best for figures with plots, diagrams
- EPS: Traditional vector format
- SVG: Web-friendly vector format

/Raster formats (for photos/microscopy):/
- TIFF: Uncompressed, high quality
- PNG: Lossless compression
- Avoid JPEG for scientific figures (lossy compression)

/When to use each:/
- Plots, diagrams → PDF or EPS (vector)
- Microscopy, photos → TIFF (high res raster)
- Mixed → TIFF at high resolution
- Supplementary web → PNG

*** Size

/Column widths (check journal guidelines):/
- Single column: typically 3-3.5 inches (7.5-9 cm)
- 1.5 column: 4.5-5.5 inches (11-14 cm)
- Full page width: 6.5-7 inches (16.5-18 cm)

/Design at final size:/
- Create figure at size it will appear in print
- Fonts will be readable when reduced
- Lines will be visible when reduced

*** Font Size

/Readable when reduced to print size:/
- Axis labels: 8-12 pt
- Tick labels: 6-10 pt
- Legend: 7-10 pt
- /Minimum 6-8 pt after reduction/

/Test readability:/
Print figure at final size and check if text is legible

*** Line Thickness

- Thick enough to see when reduced
- Minimum 0.5 pt after reduction
- Main lines: 1-2 pt
- Grid lines: 0.5-1 pt (if used)

*** Colors

/Colorblind-friendly palettes:/
- Avoid red-green combinations alone
- Use blue-orange, purple-orange combinations
- Add patterns/shapes in addition to color
- Test with colorblind simulator

/Common colorblind-safe palettes:/
- Okabe-Ito palette (designed for colorblindness)
- Viridis, plasma, cividis (sequential)
- ColorBrewer palettes marked colorblind-safe

/Consider grayscale printing:/
- Will colors be distinguishable in grayscale?
- Use different line styles (solid, dashed, dotted)
- Use different markers (circle, square, triangle)

/Python example:/
#+begin_src python
# Colorblind-friendly Okabe-Ito palette
colors = ['#E69F00', '#56B4E9', '#009E73', '#F0E442',
          '#0072B2', '#D55E00', '#CC79A7']
#+end_src

** Essential Figure Elements

*** Axis Labels

/Always include:/
- What is plotted (e.g., "Cell Viability")
- Units in parentheses or after comma

/Examples:/
- "Time (hours)"
- "Expression (fold change)"
- "Temperature, °C"
- "Voltage (mV)"

/Don't:/
- Leave axes unlabeled
- Forget units
- Use unclear abbreviations

*** Legends

/Include when:/
- Multiple data series
- Different symbols/colors need explanation

/Design tips:/
- Inside plot area if space allows
- Outside if crowded
- Horizontal if few items
- Vertical if many items
- Direct labeling preferred if possible (label right on plot)

*** Error Bars

/Always include uncertainty measure:/
- Standard deviation (SD): shows data spread
- Standard error (SE): shows uncertainty in mean
- Confidence interval (CI): shows likely range for true value

/Must specify which in caption:/
"Error bars represent mean ± SD (n=3)"
"Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals"

/Visual design:/
- Caps on error bars helpful
- Not so thick they obscure data
- Consider shaded regions for continuous data

*** Statistical Annotations

/Show significance on figures:/
- Asterisks: / p < 0.05, / p < 0.01, ** p < 0.001
- Exact p-values if space allows
- Brackets showing what's being compared
- ns = not significant

/Example:/
#+begin_src 
     ***
  ┌─────┐
  │     │
 ─┘     └─
Group1 Group2
#+end_src

*** Scale Bars (for images)

/Required for microscopy/images:/
- White or black bar
- Size labeled (e.g., "10 μm")
- Placed in corner, not obscuring features
- Same scale for images being compared (or clearly state different)

*** Panel Labels

/Multi-panel figures:/
- Label A, B, C or a, b, c
- Consistent size and placement
- Top-left corner typical
- Bold, large enough to see: 10-14 pt

/Example:/
#+begin_src 
A                    B
[Image 1]           [Graph 1]

C                    D
[Graph 2]           [Image 2]
#+end_src

** Caption Writing

*** Caption Structure

/Standard format:/
1. Opening sentence: What figure shows overall
2. Panel descriptions: Detail each panel (A, B, C...)
3. Statistical information: n, test used, significance
4. Symbol/color definitions: What symbols/colors mean
5. Additional details: Methods specifics if not in text

*** Examples

/Good caption:/
"Figure 1. Treatment increases cell viability dose-dependently. (A) Representative microscopy images of control and treated cells. Scale bar = 20 μm. (B) Quantification of cell viability at different treatment concentrations. Data are mean ± SD from three independent experiments (n=3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. control by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test"

/Poor caption:/
"Figure 1. Cell viability"
(Too vague, missing details)

*** Captions Should Be Self-Contained

/Reader should understand figure without reading main text/

/Include:/
- What was measured
- What conditions/groups
- What statistics represent (SD, SE, CI)
- What statistical test was used
- Sample size (n)
- Meaning of symbols/colors

/Don't:/
- Repeat results text word-for-word
- Include extensive interpretation (that's for main text)

** Common Figure Problems

*** Problem: Fonts Too Small

/Symptom:/ After reducing to column width, text unreadable

/Fix:/ Design figure at final print size, use minimum 8 pt fonts

*** Problem: Insufficient Contrast

/Symptom:/ Light colors on white background hard to see

/Fix:/ Use darker colors, higher contrast, or add background shading

*** Problem: Missing Error Bars

/Symptom:/ Bar/point plots without uncertainty measures

/Fix:/ Always include error bars; state what they represent in caption

*** Problem: No Units on Axes

/Symptom:/ Axis says "Temperature" but doesn't say °C or K

/Fix:/ Always include units: "Temperature (°C)"

*** Problem: Unclear Legends

/Symptom:/ Symbols not explained, or legend abbreviations undefined

/Fix:/ Define all symbols in legend or caption; spell out abbreviations

*** Problem: Low Resolution

/Symptom:/ Pixelated when viewed at final size

/Fix:/ Save at minimum 300 DPI; use vector formats when possible

*** Problem: Inappropriate Plot Type

/Symptom:/ Bar plot used for continuous data, line plot for categorical

/Fix:/ Match plot type to data type (see section above)

*** Problem: Misleading Axes

/Symptom:/ Y-axis doesn't start at zero, exaggerating small differences

/Fix:/ Start at zero for bar plots, or use axis break symbol; for other plots, choose range that honestly represents data

*** Problem: Too Much Information

/Symptom:/ Figure cluttered, hard to interpret

/Fix:/ Split into multiple panels or figures; simplify; focus on main message

** Creating Figures with matplotlib (Python)

#+begin_src python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Publication-quality defaults
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 300
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 10
plt.rcParams['font.family'] = 'Arial'
plt.rcParams['axes.linewidth'] = 1
plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.5

# Create figure at final size (single column = 3.5 inches)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3.5, 2.5))

# Example data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 50)
y1 = np.sin(x)
y2 = np.cos(x)
err = 0.1

# Plot with error shading
ax.plot(x, y1, label='Condition A', color='#0072B2')
ax.fill_between(x, y1-err, y1+err, alpha=0.3, color='#0072B2')

ax.plot(x, y2, label='Condition B', color='#D55E00')
ax.fill_between(x, y2-err, y2+err, alpha=0.3, color='#D55E00')

# Labels with units
ax.set_xlabel('Time (hours)')
ax.set_ylabel('Expression (fold change)')

# Legend
ax.legend(frameon=False)

# Remove top and right spines for cleaner look
ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)

# Save as vector and raster
fig.savefig('figure1.pdf', bbox_inches='tight')
fig.savefig('figure1.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()
#+end_src

** Multi-Panel Figures

/When to use:/
- Related data that should be viewed together
- Sequential experiments
- Different views of same phenomenon
- Comparison of conditions

/Layout tips:/
- Logical flow (left to right, top to bottom)
- Consistent size for similar panels
- Align axes where possible
- Panel labels (A, B, C) in consistent position

/Python example:/
#+begin_src python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(7, 6))

# Label panels
labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
for ax, label in zip(axes.flat, labels):
    ax.text(-0.1, 1.1, label, transform=ax.transAxes,
            fontsize=12, fontweight='bold', va='top')

    # Plot in each panel
    ax.plot(x, y)
    ax.set_xlabel('X Label')
    ax.set_ylabel('Y Label')

plt.tight_layout()
fig.savefig('multipanel.pdf')
#+end_src

** Color Schemes

*** Sequential (for ordered data, low to high)
- Single hue, increasing intensity
- Use: heatmaps, gradients
- Examples: Blues, Greens, viridis, plasma

*** Diverging (for data with meaningful midpoint)
- Two hues, diverging from neutral center
- Use: fold changes, correlations
- Examples: RdBu (red-blue), PiYG (pink-green)

*** Qualitative (for categorical data)
- Distinct hues for different categories
- Use: different conditions, groups
- Examples: Set1, Set2, tab10, Okabe-Ito
