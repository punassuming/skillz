* Review Article Writing

Guide to writing effective literature review articles.

** Review Article Types

*** Narrative Review
/Characteristics:/ Broad overview, expert perspective, not systematic
/Use:/ General audience, providing perspective on field
/Structure:/ Flexible, thematic organization

*** Systematic Review
/Characteristics:/ Structured search protocol, reproducible, comprehensive
/Use:/ Evidence synthesis, clinical guidelines
/Structure:/ PRISMA guidelines (for medical reviews)
/Includes:/ Search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, quality assessment

*** Meta-Analysis
/Characteristics:/ Quantitative synthesis of multiple studies
/Use:/ Pooling effect sizes, resolving contradictions
/Includes:/ Statistical combination of results, heterogeneity assessment

*** Scoping Review
/Characteristics:/ Maps literature landscape, identifies gaps
/Use:/ Emerging topics, identifying research needs
/Structure:/ Broad inclusion, categorization of literature

** Review Structure

*** Abstract
- Background/context
- Scope of review
- Key findings/themes
- Conclusions/implications

*** Introduction
- Why topic is important
- Scope of review (what's included/excluded)
- Organization of review
- Search strategy (if systematic)

*** Thematic Sections
- /Not chronological listing of papers/
- Organized by theme/topic/question
- Compare and contrast findings
- Synthesize across studies

*** Current State and Future Directions
- What do we know?
- What are the gaps?
- What's needed next?

*** Conclusions
- Summary of key points
- Main take-home messages
- Implications for field/practice

** Literature Organization

*** By Theme (Preferred)

/Example (autophagy review):/
- Molecular mechanisms of autophagy initiation
- Autophagy in development
- Autophagy in disease
- Therapeutic targeting of autophagy

*** By Methodology

/Example (imaging review):/
- Fluorescence microscopy approaches
- Super-resolution imaging
- Live-cell imaging
- Electron microscopy

*** By Theoretical Framework

/Example (social science review):/
- Behavioral theories
- Cognitive theories
- Social theories

*** NOT Chronological Overall

❌ /Poor:/ "In 2010, Smith studied X. In 2012, Jones studied Y. In 2015, Brown studied Z..."

✅ /Good:/ Chronology WITHIN themes if showing development: "Initial studies of X [2010 refs] were extended by [2015 refs] and recently [2020 refs]"

** Synthesis Strategies

*** Identify Patterns

"Multiple studies demonstrate that X affects Y [refs 5-12], though the magnitude varies with [context]"

*** Compare Methodologies

"Studies using method A found X [refs], while those using method B found Y [refs]. This discrepancy may reflect [methodological difference]"

*** Highlight Controversies

"The role of X in Y remains controversial. Some evidence supports [position 1, refs], while other studies suggest [position 2, refs]"

*** Integrate Findings

"Collectively, these findings suggest that X regulates Y through multiple mechanisms, including A [refs], B [refs], and C [refs]"

*** Don't Just List

❌ "Smith found X [1]. Jones found Y [2]. Brown found Z [3]."

✅ "X has been shown to regulate Y through multiple mechanisms [1-3], with recent work revealing..."

** Critical Evaluation

*** Assess Study Quality

- Sample size
- Methodology rigor
- Appropriate controls
- Statistical power
- Potential biases

*** Note Limitations

"While these studies provide important insights, limitations include [small sample sizes, single cell line, etc.]"

*** Identify Conflicting Evidence

"Contradictory findings regarding X may reflect differences in [experimental conditions, populations studied, methodologies]"

*** Methodological Biases

"Publication bias may exist, as negative results are underreported"
"Most studies used [one approach], limiting generalizability"

** Figure/Table Types for Reviews

*** Summary Tables

Compare studies side-by-side:

| Study | Model | Method | Finding | Ref |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|-----|
| Smith 2020 | Mice | qPCR | X↑ | [5] |
| Jones 2021 | Cells | RNA-seq | X↑ | [6] |
| Brown 2022 | Human | Array | X→ | [7] |

*** Conceptual Figures

- Synthesize models from literature
- Show relationships between concepts
- Illustrate mechanisms
- Timeline of developments

*** Meta-Analysis Plots

- Forest plots showing effect sizes
- Funnel plots for publication bias
- Heterogeneity assessments

*** Pathway/Network Diagrams

- Integrate findings into comprehensive model
- Show connections between studies

** Systematic Review Protocol (PRISMA)

*** Define Question (PICO)

- /P/opulation
- /I/ntervention/Exposure
- /C/omparison
- /O/utcome

*** Search Strategy

- Databases searched (PubMed, Web of Science, etc.)
- Search terms used
- Date range
- Language restrictions

*** Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

/Explicit criteria:/
- Study design (RCT, cohort, case-control, etc.)
- Population characteristics
- Interventions/exposures
- Outcomes measured
- Publication language
- Date range

*** Study Selection

- Number of records identified
- Number screened
- Number excluded with reasons
- Number included in review

/PRISMA flow diagram/ shows this process

*** Quality Assessment

- Use validated tools (GRADE, Cochrane risk of bias, etc.)
- Assess each study's quality
- Note limitations

*** Data Extraction

- Standardized form
- Key information from each study
- Results, sample sizes, methods

** Common Review Problems

*** Problem: Laundry List of Studies

/Symptom:/ "Smith found X. Jones found Y. Brown found Z..." (no synthesis)

/Fix:/ Group thematically, identify patterns, synthesize findings

*** Problem: Lack of Critical Evaluation

/Symptom:/ Accepting all findings equally without assessing quality

/Fix:/ Evaluate study quality, note limitations, identify strong vs. weak evidence

*** Problem: Missing Recent Literature

/Symptom:/ Most recent refs are 2+ years old

/Fix:/ Update search before submission, include latest findings

*** Problem: Too Narrow

/Symptom:/ Only includes work from one lab or one perspective

/Fix:/ Broaden search, include diverse perspectives

*** Problem: Too Broad

/Symptom:/ Trying to cover entire field in one review

/Fix:/ Focus on specific question/aspect

*** Problem: Unclear Scope

/Symptom:/ Reader doesn't know what review covers

/Fix:/ Explicitly state scope in introduction

** Review Checklist
