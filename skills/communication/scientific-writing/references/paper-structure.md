Comprehensive guide to organizing research papers using IMRAD and alternative structures.

** IMRAD Structure

The most common structure for experimental research papers in sciences.

*** Introduction

*Purpose:* Establish context, identify gap, state objective

*Structure (funnel approach):*
1. *Broad context* (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Why general topic matters
   - Current state of knowledge
   - Importance to field/society

2. *Narrow focus* (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Zoom into specific problem area
   - Review relevant previous work
   - Synthesize what's known

3. *Knowledge gap* (1 paragraph)
   - What's unknown or needs improvement
   - Why gap is important
   - Types: knowledge gap, methodological gap, application gap, resolution gap

4. *Objective* (1 paragraph, often last)
   - What this study does
   - Clear, specific, testable
   - Can include hypotheses

5. *Approach overview* (optional, 1-2 sentences)
   - Brief description of methods used
   - Not detailed (that's for Methods section)

*Length:* Typically 1-3 pages (2-5 paragraphs for short papers, up to 10 for longer)

*What belongs here:*
- Context and background
- Literature review (synthesis, not exhaustive)
- Rationale for your study
- Clear statement of objectives

*What doesn't belong:*
- Detailed methods
- Results
- Extensive review (that's for review papers)
- Conclusions

*** Methods

*Purpose:* Provide sufficient detail for reproducibility

*Organization strategies:*

*1. Chronological order* (when sequence matters)
#+begin_example
Sample collection → Preparation → Analysis → Statistics
#+end_example
Good for: Sequential processes, time-dependent experiments

*2. By subsystem/component* (complex systems)
#+begin_example
Cell culture → Transfection → Imaging → Quantification → Statistics
#+end_example
Good for: Multi-step experimental workflows

*3. By type of measurement* (multiple assays)
#+begin_example
Materials → Cell viability assay → Gene expression → Protein analysis → Statistics
#+end_example
Good for: Multiple independent measurements

*Essential elements:*

*Materials:*
- Equipment: manufacturer, model, specifications
  - Example: "Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with 63× oil-immersion objective (NA 1.4)"
- Reagents: source, catalog number, concentration, purity
  - Example: "Cells were treated with doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich, D1515) at 1 μM for 24 hours"
- Software: name, version, manufacturer, parameters
  - Example: "Images were analyzed using ImageJ (version 1.53, NIH) with default thresholding"

*Experimental procedures:*
- Novel methods: Full detail, every step
- Standard methods: Brief description + citation
  - Example: "RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions"
- Modified methods: Highlight what changed
  - Example: "Protein extraction was performed as described [12] with modifications: lysis buffer included 1% SDS instead of 0.1%"

*Sample sizes and replication:*
- Number of biological replicates
- Number of technical replicates
- Justification (power analysis if available)
- Example: "Each experiment was performed in triplicate with n=5 biological replicates (15 total measurements)"

*Statistical analysis:*
- Software used
- Tests applied and why
- Significance level (typically α = 0.05)
- Multiple comparison corrections
- Example: "Statistical analysis was performed in R (version 4.2). Groups were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD post-hoc test. Significance was set at p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons"

*Ethics and compliance:*
- IRB/IACUC approval numbers
- Patient consent statements
- Data availability statements

*What belongs here:*
- All experimental procedures
- Equipment and materials
- Statistical methods
- Study design

*What doesn't belong:*
- Results (observations)
- Rationale (goes in Introduction)
- Interpretation (goes in Discussion)

*** Results

*Purpose:* Report observations objectively without interpretation

*Organization strategies:*

*1. Chronological* (experiments in sequence)
- Good when later experiments build on earlier
- Example: "First we established... Next we tested... Finally we examined..."

*2. By importance* (most significant first)
- Lead with strongest findings
- Good for high-impact journals

*3. By theme* (related findings grouped)
- Example: "Effect on gene expression... Effect on protein levels... Effect on cell function..."

*4. By hypothesis* (addressed one by one)
- Example: "To test whether X affects Y... To determine if A relates to B..."

*Objectivity principles:*

*Do:*
- Report what you observed
- Use "data show," "results indicate," "we observed"
- Present negative results honestly
- Include measures of variability (SD, SE, CI)

*Don't:*
- Interpret findings (save for Discussion)
- Use "data prove," "data demonstrate" (too strong)
- Cherry-pick results
- Editorialize ("surprisingly," "interestingly" - save for Discussion)

*Figure and table integration:*

*Every figure/table MUST:*
- Be referenced in text: "Figure 1 shows..." or "(Figure 1)"
- Have findings described in text
- Be numbered sequentially in order of mention

*Good integration:*
"Expression of Gene X increased 3-fold in treated cells compared to controls (Figure 2A, p < 0.001)"

*Poor integration:*
"See Figure 2 for expression data" (too vague)
"Figure 2" (not referenced with findings)

*Statistical reporting requirements:*
- Test statistic with symbol (t, F, χ², etc.)
- Degrees of freedom
- Exact p-value (not just p < 0.05)
- Effect size when applicable
- Measures of variability

*Complete example:*
"Treated cells showed significantly higher viability than controls (mean ± SD: 85 ± 7% vs 62 ± 9%; t₁₈ = 4.32, p = 0.003, Cohen's d = 2.1)"

*What belongs here:*
- Observations from experiments
- Data (numbers, statistics)
- References to figures/tables

*What doesn't belong:*
- Interpretation ("this suggests," "therefore")
- Comparison to literature (goes in Discussion)
- Methods details
- Speculation

*** Discussion

*Purpose:* Interpret results in context, acknowledge limitations, discuss implications

*Structure:*

*1. Opening (1 paragraph):*
- Restate main findings briefly
- State whether hypothesis supported
- Example: "This study demonstrated that X increases Y in Z cells, supporting our hypothesis that..."

*2. Interpretation in context (2-4 paragraphs):*
- What do results mean?
- How do they relate to previous work?
- Agree with literature: "Our findings are consistent with Smith et al. [15], who showed..."
- Disagree with literature: "In contrast to previous reports [12], we found... This discrepancy may be due to differences in..."
- Extend literature: "Building on earlier work [8], our results demonstrate that..."

*3. Mechanistic explanation (1-2 paragraphs, if applicable):*
- How do you explain your findings?
- What mechanism might account for observations?
- Support with evidence
- Acknowledge alternative explanations

*4. Limitations (1 paragraph):*
- Be honest but not self-defeating
- Explain impact of limitations
- Suggest how limitations could be addressed
- Example: "This study focused on acute treatment (24 hours); chronic effects may differ and warrant investigation. Additionally, we examined only one cell line; validation in primary cells would strengthen conclusions"

*5. Implications and significance (1 paragraph):*
- Why do findings matter?
- Impact on field
- Practical applications
- Example: "These findings suggest that targeting X may be a therapeutic strategy for Y"

*6. Future directions (1 paragraph):*
- What's the next logical step?
- What questions remain?
- How to extend this work?

*7. Closing (1-2 sentences):*
- Brief conclusion statement
- Or transition to separate Conclusions section

*Interpretation strategies:*

*Support interpretations:*
- "These results suggest..." (tentative)
- "The data support..." (stronger)
- "One possible explanation is..."
- "This finding may reflect..."

*Consider alternatives:*
- "Alternative explanations include..."
- "However, we cannot rule out..."
- "Another possibility is..."

*Link to introduction:*
- Address the gap identified in introduction
- Answer the question posed
- Show how findings advance field

*What belongs here:*
- Interpretation of results
- Comparison with literature
- Mechanistic explanations
- Limitations
- Implications
- Future directions

*What doesn't belong:*
- New results not in Results section
- Extensive methods details
- Speculation without evidence
- Repetition of results without interpretation

*** Conclusions (if separate from Discussion)

*Purpose:* Summarize key findings and significance

*Structure:*
- 1-2 paragraphs
- Restate main findings
- Emphasize significance
- Broader implications
- No new information
- Can include future outlook

*Example:*
"In summary, this study demonstrated that X regulates Y through Z mechanism in A cells. These findings advance understanding of B process and suggest that C may be a therapeutic target for D. Future work examining E in F will further elucidate this pathway"
